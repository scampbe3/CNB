As a freelance web dev, I need your best comprehensive plan for specifically how to tackle this project. As much custom code as possible. Code should be built to fit in seamlessly with the platforms specified. But we want to create as much time as possible in our own custom code files from scratch, then insert into the platforms mentioned. Take your time, think step by step, and create a comprehensive plan that I can use to follow step by step on how to create and complete this project on a technical level to meet the client's specifications. Thank you.

Thanks for the detailed prompt and the brief. Before I create the full step-by-step technical plan, could you please confirm a few key details so I tailor the code approach properly?

For the Squarespace (C+B) build:

Do you have the Business or Commerce plan (required for full code injection and custom blocks)?

Will we be using Squarespace 7.1 or Fluid Engine?

For the Shopify (Lillier) build:

Will you be using Online Store 2.0 with a custom theme, or modifying an existing one?

Should the Shopify theme be built from scratch using Shopify CLI + Liquid/React, or heavily customized from a base theme like Dawn?

Do you have any third-party tools already selected for subscriptions (e.g. Memberstack, Outseta, Stripe Customer Portal) or should I include that research/recommendation in the plan?

Is your goal to minimize visual design tooling in-platform (e.g., no drag-and-drop editors), and instead manage most design via hand-coded HTML/CSS/JS?

Once I have this info, I’ll create a complete development plan that prioritizes building custom code locally and inserting it into Squarespace and Shopify as cleanly and scalably as possible.

You said:
1a. I don't but I know the client does. 1b. Engine unknown.
2a. Unknown - what do you recommend? 2b. Same answer.
3a. Nothing as yet selected, I defer to you.
4a. Correct. But recall from the client specifications that when complete, it needs to be easy for them to extend (i.e. client needs to be able to add a new page easily, edit a page, etc). So for MY DEVELOPMENT I need custom code as much as possible. At the end hand off though, it needs to be easily client-editable.

Development Plan for Cupcakes+Broccoli (Squarespace 7.1) and Lillier (Shopify OS 2.0)
1. Local Development Environment Setup
Squarespace (C+B) Local Setup: Since Squarespace 7.1 doesn’t support full Developer Mode, plan to build and test custom code locally, then inject it into Squarespace. Create a local project folder for C+B with subfolders for HTML prototypes, CSS, and JS. You can prototype key page layouts in plain HTML/CSS/JS on your computer, using the same classes and structure you’ll later use in Squarespace code blocks. While you cannot run the Squarespace site itself locally on 7.1, you can simulate pages by recreating their structure in static HTML and testing your custom code there. Once satisfied, you’ll embed this code into Squarespace via code injection or code blocks (detailed in Section 3)
. Use a staging Squarespace site or a trial site to safely paste and refine your code before the production site. Shopify (Lillier) Local Setup: Leverage Shopify’s CLI tools to develop the Lillier theme locally. Begin by installing the Shopify CLI and using it to initialize a new theme based on Shopify’s Dawn (Online Store 2.0 reference theme)
. For example:
npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme    # Install Shopify CLI
shopify theme init [theme-name]               # Clone Dawn into a new theme project
cd [theme-name]
This will create a local theme folder with Dawn’s files as a starting point. Next, create a Shopify development store (via the Shopify Partner dashboard) to preview your theme. Use the CLI’s development server to watch for changes and sync to your dev store in real-time
:
shopify theme dev --store your-dev-store.myshopify.com
This command uploads your local theme and allows live preview at a special development URL. As you edit files locally (Liquid, JSON, CSS, JS), changes will hot-reload in the browser. Keep this server running during development. Use version control (Git) for your theme code to track changes. Once the theme is ready, you can push it to the live store either by using shopify theme push
 or by connecting a GitHub repo in Shopify for CI deployment. Set up a theme development workflow: work on the development theme in the Shopify store, test thoroughly, then publish as the live theme when approved. This approach ensures you have a sandbox for Lillier that won’t affect customers until deployment.
2. Unified Design System & Component Architecture
To maintain subtle brand cohesion between C+B and Lillier, establish a unified design system that both sites will use. This includes a shared visual language (colors, typography, spacing, and UI components) and consistent UX patterns, implemented separately on each platform:
Define Design Tokens: Decide on a common palette (primary, secondary, neutral colors) and typography (font families for headings, body, accents) that both brands will use. For consistency, create a style guide document. For example, if both brands use a signature color (with C+B perhaps using a vibrant accent and Lillier a more muted tone), include those in the palette. Define CSS variables or LESS variables for these tokens in your code. Squarespace: The Custom CSS editor supports LESS, so you can define variables like @primary-color and reuse them
. Shopify: You can use CSS custom properties or SCSS (if you set up a build step) for the same effect. This way, a change in the design system (e.g. adjusting a color shade) can be mirrored on both sites by updating the respective variable.
Shared Components: Identify key UI components that will appear on both sites, and design them to have a similar look and feel. Examples: navigation bar, footer, buttons, form inputs, cards for content or products, modal dialogs, etc. Document the HTML/CSS structure for these components and implement them in each platform. For instance, define a button style (border radius, hover effect, font) and apply it via a CSS class .btn in both Squarespace (via custom CSS) and Shopify (in theme CSS). Ensure both sites’ buttons feel related (same shape and scale) even if colors differ slightly per brand. Another example: both sites might use a hero section with a large background image/video and a bold heading. The C+B hero might feature an educational tagline, while Lillier’s hero might show a product or lifestyle image – but the layout and typography can be alike.
Responsive, Mobile-First Design: Both sites should be designed mobile-first, given Lillier’s emphasis on mobile usage and C+B’s broad audience. Define breakpoints and make sure your CSS adapts components for smaller screens gracefully (e.g. nav collapses into a mobile menu, grids become single column). Test your design system components on mobile early. On Shopify, Dawn is mobile-first and already includes responsive grid and typography settings which you can customize; on Squarespace, use CSS media queries in the Custom CSS to adjust styling for mobile if needed (and Squarespace’s built-in styles will also handle responsiveness for standard blocks).
Subtle Brand Distinctions: While the overall structure and components are shared, allow for subtle differences to reinforce each brand’s identity. For example, C+B (education platform) might use more vibrant accent colors or playful imagery (reflecting “Cupcakes + Broccoli” – a mix of fun and healthy), whereas Lillier (marketplace) might use a refined, minimalist aesthetic (inspired by Aesop’s clean design). The typography could differ (e.g., a serif font for C+B’s editorial feel and a modern sans-serif for Lillier’s product focus), but still chosen to complement each other. Ensure these variations are captured in the design system: perhaps two theme variants of the style guide, one for each brand, that share base components but swap out certain styles.
Component Architecture: In code terms, break down pages into sections/components. For instance, a card component for previewing an article or product should have a consistent structure: image on top, title, maybe author or price info. You’ll implement it in Squarespace by either using a Summary Block styled via CSS or a custom code block, and in Shopify as a Liquid snippet or section for product cards. By planning these components in the abstract, you ensure both implementations follow the same pattern. This will also help in maintaining cohesion: if you adjust the design of a component in one site, you can mirror it on the other. Keep a checklist of components (hero, card, carousel, testimonial, etc.) that need implementation on both platforms.
3. Developing Cupcakes+Broccoli on Squarespace 7.1 (Education Platform)
Cupcakes+Broccoli (C+B) will be built on Squarespace 7.1, utilizing as much custom code as needed for unique features, while still leveraging Squarespace’s CMS for ease of client editing. Below is a step-by-step approach: 3.1 Choose Base Template & Structure: Start with a Squarespace 7.1 template (since all 7.1 templates share the same underlying framework, you can choose any that closely matches the navigation layout you want). Set up the basic site structure: pages for key sections like Home, About, Blog/Articles, maybe Tools, Events, etc., and ensure the navigation menu has the necessary links. Configure site style settings for basic fonts, text sizes, and colors to approximate your design system (this makes default blocks look on-brand without code). For example, set the base font to your chosen body font, set heading fonts/sizes to something close to your design, and adjust built-in color themes if needed. 3.2 Inject Global Custom Code (HTML/CSS/JS): Squarespace 7.1 doesn’t allow editing template files directly
, but it provides Custom Code Injection and Custom CSS options. Use these to add site-wide code:
Global CSS: Open Design > Custom CSS in Squarespace and add your stylesheet (you can paste your entire compiled CSS/LESS here)
. This CSS will override or augment the template’s styles globally. Here you will implement the design system: e.g., define your color variables (LESS: @primary-color: #...;), style for classes you plan to use (e.g., .btn { ... }, .hero-section { ... }), and overrides for Squarespace defaults (like making default buttons or headings match your design). Keep the CSS organized and commented for maintainability (e.g., section off “Header styles”, “Footer styles”, etc.).
Header Injection (Site-Wide): In Settings > Advanced > Code Injection, use the Header field to insert any scripts or <meta> tags that should load on every page
. This is the place for external libraries (for example, if you need a specific JavaScript library for interactive tools or a CSS framework reset) and for site metadata. For C+B, a likely use is inserting the Outseta membership script here (see Section 3.5) so that membership modals and gating apply globally
. Also include any needed polyfills or utility scripts. Make sure to wrap scripts in <script> tags and CSS in <style> if adding via this panel. (Tip: Only load what’s necessary globally to keep performance high. For instance, your AI tool script might only be needed on a specific page – that can be loaded via page-specific injection instead of globally.)
Footer Injection (Site-Wide): Still in Code Injection, use the Footer field for any scripts that should run after the page loads
. This is ideal for your custom JavaScript that enhances UI components or initializes plugins on the page, since it will load without blocking the main content. For example, if you have written a custom JS file for interactive behavior (like toggling UI elements or integrating with an API), you can place it here inside <script> tags or reference an external script URL. By loading in the footer, you ensure all DOM elements are present when the script runs, and it won’t delay page rendering.
3.3 Page-Specific Custom Code: For pages that need unique code (HTML or JS), use Squarespace Code Blocks or page header injection:
Code Blocks for Custom Sections: Squarespace’s Code Block allows inserting arbitrary HTML/JS into page content
. Use these blocks to create structured content where Squarespace’s native blocks are insufficient. For example, the C+B homepage might need a custom hero section with a background video and a marketing headline. You can implement this by adding a Code Block at the top of the page and pasting your HTML structure for the hero (e.g., a <section class="hero-section"> containing an <video> tag or an image and heading text). Then your global CSS (added earlier) will style .hero-section accordingly. Another example: if you have an AI tool page where users input text to get AI-generated output, you can create a Code Block that contains the HTML for the tool interface (input fields, results container) and a <script> that initializes the AI API call. Keep Code Block HTML clean and minimal, using classes and IDs that your CSS/JS target.
Page Header Injection (per-page): Squarespace also allows adding code that applies only to a specific page. In the page’s settings (Pages > gear icon > Advanced > Header), you can inject code that will be added to that page’s head or top of body
. Use this for scripts or style needed only on one page. For instance, if the AI tool uses a large third-party script that you’d prefer not to load on every page, you can include its <script src="..."> via that page’s header injection. This keeps it lightweight on other pages
. Likewise, if one page needs custom CSS tweaks not relevant elsewhere, you can add a <style> block in that page’s header. Remember that page-specific injection should be used sparingly and only for truly page-specific needs; for most styling and interactive behavior, it’s better to have it in global CSS/JS and just scope it with page-specific selectors (Squarespace gives each page a unique ID in the HTML which you can use in your CSS to target that page).
3.4 Using Squarespace Native Features vs Custom Code: To ensure the client can easily edit content, lean on native Squarespace content types when possible, and enhance them with custom code:
Blog for Articles or Courses: If C+B will publish articles, tutorials, or course content, use the built-in Blog or Pages collection for this content so the client can add entries in the Squarespace UI. You can then style the list of posts with CSS to achieve an editorial look. For example, a blog page can list entries with a featured image and excerpt – use CSS to style that list to match your design (or use a Summary Block to lay them out in a grid and style it). This way, adding new content doesn’t require coding. If courses need to be behind a paywall, you could still use a Blog or Collection for courses and simply restrict access (see 3.5 below).
Gallery or Summary Blocks: For any curated lists (e.g., a list of resources or tools on C+B), consider using a Collection (like a Gallery or Custom Collection) and a Summary Block to display it. Then apply CSS to that Summary Block to adjust the layout (e.g., remove unwanted padding, style titles). This gives the client a graphical way to add items (just add an item to the collection) while your code handles the presentation.
Built-in Forms and Integrations: If C+B needs forms (contact, sign-up for newsletter), use Squarespace’s Form Blocks for ease, and style them via CSS for consistency. If the design calls for something more custom-looking, you can still use the form block HTML (which has known structure) and just hide or rearrange elements with CSS/JS as needed, rather than coding an entire form from scratch.
In general, reserve pure custom code solutions for elements Squarespace cannot handle. This ensures after handoff the client can use Squarespace’s UI for most content updates, and the custom code acts as a layer of enhancement. 3.5 Membership & Subscription Integration (C+B): A core feature is a members-only area with subscription payments. Squarespace offers Member Areas natively, but you may opt for a third-party integration like Outseta (or MemberSpace) for more flexibility and lower fees
. Evaluate options and implement as follows:
Squarespace Member Areas (Built-in): This is the simplest to implement through the Squarespace interface. Enable Member Areas, set up subscription products and pricing in Squarespace, and assign pages to those member areas (thus gating them). Little custom code is needed; Squarespace handles login, account management, and paywall. Drawback: Squarespace charges a transaction fee (~9% on member payments)
 which is significant. Also design control on the login/account screens might be limited.
Outseta Integration: Outseta is an all-in-one membership toolkit that was used on Squarespace’s own site historically
. To integrate Outseta:
Sign up for Outseta and configure your membership plans (pricing, etc.) and connect Stripe in Outseta’s settings
.
Add Outseta’s embed script. Copy the Outseta Quick Start embed code (a script tag) from Outseta’s dashboard, and paste it into Squarespace’s global header code injection
. This script will enable Outseta’s auth system across your site.
Add membership trigger links/buttons. Outseta provides special links for sign-up, login, logout, and account profile pop-ups
. In your site’s header or nav, create buttons or links for “Login” / “Sign Up” and set their URLs to those Outseta-provided links (e.g. href="https://[yourcompany].outseta.com/auth/login" or a special <a data-outseta-modal="login"> format, per Outseta docs). Ensure these open in the same tab (not new tab) so they trigger the modal
.
Protect content: Outseta can restrict page access. Typically, you’d wrap members-only page content in a special div with attributes (if Outseta requires) or simply rely on Outseta’s ability to redirect users who aren’t logged in when they try to access certain URLs (configured in Outseta’s Protected Content settings). You might need to add a small script in page header injection for protected pages to check Outseta’s auth state and hide/show content accordingly (Outseta’s docs will provide the exact method). Test this thoroughly: try accessing a members page while logged out to ensure it prompts login or shows a “Members only” message.
Outseta also provides additional features (CRM, email). If needed, integrate those (for example, use Outseta’s email list instead of Squarespace’s newsletter).
MemberStack or MemberSpace: These are alternative membership solutions. MemberStack historically didn’t officially support Squarespace easily, and MemberSpace does support Squarespace by overlaying a login system. If you choose MemberSpace, you’d add their code snippet via code injection and configure protected pages in MemberSpace’s dashboard. The implementation would be similar: insert script, set up login/signup widgets (often MemberSpace can overlay a login form on top of Squarespace). The plan would be: sign up for MemberSpace, configure plans (it can integrate with Stripe), inject their script, and test page gating. Outseta is a more all-in-one solution, but MemberSpace might be simpler if only gating is needed. Note: Only choose one platform to avoid conflicts; Outseta is a strong choice given the client’s needs and its integration guide.
Custom Stripe + Custom Auth: Not recommended unless necessary. This would involve building your own membership system: embedding Stripe Checkout for subscription payments and writing custom code to create user accounts and limit content. Squarespace doesn’t give server-side code access, so you’d likely need an external database or service to track users. This approach is complex and beyond the scope of a quick launch. Instead, using the above services leverages their secure user authentication. If a truly custom approach is desired, consider building a separate web app for login and using the Squarespace site mainly as marketing, but that contradicts the requirement to use Squarespace. Thus, in this plan we stick with either Squarespace Member Areas or an integration like Outseta for subscriptions.
Implement the membership system early in development so you can incorporate any specific requirements (like adding a “My Account” page link, or showing/hiding certain menu items based on login state – which you can do with a bit of JS that checks if user is logged in via Outseta’s JS API or MemberSpace’s API). 3.6 Content & Features for C+B:
Educational Content Pages: Build out a template or consistent layout for content pages such as articles or course pages. If using a Blog for courses/articles, style the blog post page via CSS (Squarespace will output the content in a structured way, e.g., blog title as an <h1>, content in a rich text format). You can add a Code Block at the end of posts for special elements like an AI-powered widget (“Try this tool” embedded in an article, for example). Ensure code doesn’t conflict with the rich text content styling.
AI Tools Integration: If C+B offers AI tools (perhaps a chatbot or a content generator for entrepreneurs), implement these likely as separate pages or modals. For example, you might create a page “Business Idea Generator” that has a custom Code Block with a text input, a button, and a <div> for output. Use JavaScript (possibly with a third-party AI API like OpenAI) to process input and show results. Because this is custom, be mindful of API keys (don’t expose them publicly; you might need to use a serverless function or a proxy if the API calls require a secret). If the AI tool is complex, consider hosting it externally and embedding via an <iframe> or widget. If using JS directly, load the script only on that page (via page header code injection or inside the Code Block). Test on desktop and mobile (especially if using modals or large results).
Community/Convening Features: The brief mentions C+B is also a convening platform. If future community forums or events are planned, note that Squarespace has limited community features. A workaround could be embedding a third-party forum (like Circle or Discourse) via an iframe or link, or using commenting features on blog posts for Q&A. For events, Squarespace does have an Events collection you could use to list events. Keep the site structure flexible to add these sections later. Possibly include a “Community” or “Forum” link in the nav that can integrate later.
Testing and QA (Squarespace): As you integrate code, frequently preview the site on various devices. Use Squarespace’s built-in device preview or simply open on actual devices. Check that your code-injected elements do not break the layout. Pay attention to Squarespace updates: since you’re injecting custom code, ensure that if Squarespace changes some markup (especially for things like product or list pages
), your code still works. For example, the Beyondspace guide notes that Squarespace might update markup for product lists which can affect custom code
. Keep custom code relatively decoupled from internal DOM if possible (e.g., target high-level containers or use your own wrappers to avoid relying on Squarespace’s internal classes that could change).
4. Developing Lillier on Shopify Online Store 2.0 (E-commerce Marketplace)
Lillier will be a Shopify-based e-commerce site, taking advantage of Online Store 2.0’s flexibility and Shopify’s robust commerce features. The plan is to build a custom Shopify theme (likely starting from Dawn for efficiency) and implement all required features (product listings, collections, checkout, etc.) with a mobile-first, clean approach. Steps and best practices: 4.1 Starting the Theme (Dawn Customization): Using the Dawn theme as a foundation
 provides a well-structured starting point with OS 2.0 features (JSON templates, sections, etc.). After initializing the theme (as done in Section 1), review the Dawn directory structure (especially the sections, snippets, templates folders):
Templates (JSON): Dawn’s /templates folder contains JSON files for each page type (e.g., index.json for home, product.json, collection.json, page.json, etc.). These define which sections are present by default on those pages
. You will modify these or create new ones if needed. For instance, if Lillier needs a special About page layout, you might create page.about.json and a corresponding alternate template in Shopify so that the About page can have a custom section arrangement.
Sections: The /sections folder has Liquid files corresponding to each section (e.g., header, footer, main-product, featured-collection, etc.). Dawn comes with many generic sections. Decide which ones to keep and which to replace or heavily restyle. Likely you will:
Customize the Header section for the Lillier branding and navigation needs (e.g., include logo, menu, perhaps a quick cart icon or account icon if needed).
Customize the Footer section similarly (update links, add any newsletter sign-up form connected to Shopify’s customer list or a Mailchimp form).
Use Dawn’s existing product grid or list sections for collection pages, but apply CSS changes to declutter (Aesop-inspired means maybe more whitespace, hide extra UI like compare buttons or overly busy badges).
Remove sections not needed (for example, if Dawn has a slideshow or rich text section not in the design, you can omit them to streamline the theme).
Create new custom sections for any unique design elements. For Lillier’s curated, editorial feel, you might introduce sections like “Featured Brand Story” (a section combining text and image in an editorial layout) or “Journal Highlights” (if Lillier includes editorial content). Use the Shopify section schema to make these configurable.
4.2 Implementing Design System in Shopify Theme: Bring the unified design styles into the theme:
CSS Styling: Dawn uses a modern CSS setup (in newer versions it might use CSS variables and a single CSS file). Locate the main CSS file (often assets/base.css or theme.css). You can directly edit this, or if you prefer, set up a SCSS compilation step. Implement the design tokens here: for example, define :root { --primary-color: ...; --font-heading: ...; } if using vanilla CSS, or use SCSS variables. Update typographic styles (headers, body text) to use the chosen fonts and sizes. Ensure to set button styles, form input styles, etc., to match those defined in the design system.
Theme Settings: To allow the client to tweak some styling easily, use theme settings (in config/settings_schema.json). For instance, define a setting for primary color, secondary color, and fonts. Dawn already has a color scheme settings and font picker in its settings – modify or add to those if needed. Then use the Liquid {{ settings.color_primary }} (or similar) in your theme CSS or styles where appropriate (Dawn might bind these to CSS variables already). This way, if the client wants to adjust a color shade, they can do it from Shopify’s Theme Editor without touching code. It also future-proofs the design system if minor brand changes occur.
Layout and HTML: Use Liquid and HTML to structure content according to your components. For example, if you want a very minimal product card (image and product name only on collection pages), edit the product-card.liquid snippet (or Dawn’s equivalent) to remove unwanted elements (like remove reviews stars, etc.), and add any wrappers needed for styling. If adding new content elements, prefer to make them configurable: e.g., if a section has text overlay on an image, use the section’s schema to provide a text field and image picker for the merchant.
4.3 Shopify Online Store 2.0 Sections & Flexibility: OS 2.0 allows merchants to add or rearrange sections on most pages
. We want Lillier’s admins to have flexibility post-handoff:
Sections on Every Page: By default, all templates (except checkout) can have dynamic sections. Ensure any unique page designs are built as sections so they can be moved or removed. For instance, the homepage will consist of multiple sections (hero, product collection highlights, editorial content, etc.). Each should be a separate section file. In the theme editor, the client can re-order or remove them. Similarly, for regular content pages, you might rely on a rich-text section for general content, but you can also create a “Custom content section” that includes rich text and an image in a certain layout for editorial storytelling – the client could add that section to any page.
JSON Templates: Plan if multiple templates are needed. Perhaps all product pages share one layout, so product.json is fine. But if some products need a different template (maybe one category of products has additional info), you can create an alternate template file and assign it to those products in Shopify. The same goes for pages: if the About page layout is special, use a separate template. In JSON, define the default sections for that template. For example, page.about.json might by default include a banner image section and a rich text section pre-added. This ensures consistency in structure but still allows editing. Document for the client which templates are used for what, so they don’t accidentally switch to a wrong template.
Metafields for Dynamic Content: Shopify now lets you define metafields easily for products and other entities (no app needed)
. If Lillier’s design calls for extra structured data (e.g., a product needs to display a “Ingredient list” or “Designer bio” on the product page like an editorial touch), use metafields. For example, add a product metafield “Brand Story” (rich text) and expose it on the product page via Liquid ({{ product.metafields.custom.brand_story }}) in a section. The client can fill that metafield in each product’s admin page without needing to touch theme code
. This aligns with the curated storytelling aspect of Lillier.
4.4 Key Template Customizations:
Homepage: Design a modular homepage with multiple custom sections. Likely sections: Hero banner (with a big image or video and tagline – allow image/video selection and text in the section settings), Featured Products or “New & Noteworthy” (a section that displays a specific collection or hand-picked products; could use Shopify’s Collection Listing section or a custom one where the merchant can pick a few products), Editorial snippet (if there’s a blog, show latest article or a special story to engage users daily), perhaps a Newsletter signup section for building community. Implement each as a section file with appropriate schema fields so the client can edit text/images. For inspiration: Aesop’s site often has a clean hero and then a grid of products with lots of whitespace; emulate that spacious layout with CSS.
Collection Pages: Use the default collection template but simplify it. Dawn by default has a sidebar filter and product grid. If “not cluttered” is the goal, you might remove the sidebar (unless filtering is desired for UX). Simplify the header of the collection page to maybe just show the collection title and description with nice typography. The products grid: adjust number of products per row on mobile vs desktop for optimal display. Possibly use 2-column on mobile to mimic an Instagram-like grid if that suits, or 1-column for a editorial feel (though that would require lots of scrolling). You can configure this via CSS or theme settings.
Product Pages: Emphasize imagery and product story. Dawn’s product page layout can be tweaked to move elements around. For example, if you want a more editorial style, you might put the product description in a tab or below the images rather than all to the right side. Keep it clean: maybe hide overly commercial elements if not needed (like quantity selector style can be minimal, etc.). Ensure that the Add to Cart button is prominent even with a minimalist design (mobile-first means make it easy to tap). If repeating purchases or subscriptions are a goal (repeat-use UX), consider enabling Shopify’s native subscription apps integration if needed, or at least ensure customer accounts and re-ordering are easy. (Shopify has a “Re-order” feature on order status page or you can add a “Buy it again” section in customer account if desired via apps or Liquid).
Cart and Checkout: Shopify checkout is not theme-editable beyond logo and colors (unless on Plus). So focus on the cart page or drawer. Decide between using a cart page or an AJAX cart drawer for smoother UX. Dawn comes with a cart drawer functionality (sidebar). Customize its appearance to match the clean style (remove any clutter like item thumbnail if you want a text-only list, or vice versa). Ensure the cart icon is visible in the header (for mobile, maybe an icon in the nav that shows item count).
Additional Pages: About, Contact, FAQ, etc. These can use the page template with the rich text section or custom sections. You might design an About section that has an image and text side by side (for brand story). Implement that as a section with those fields so the client can edit the about content visually. For a Contact page, Shopify’s contact form can be enabled by creating a page with the contact template. Style that form through CSS to match the theme.
4.5 Shopify Liquid and Code Tips:
Liquid Templating: Use Liquid for dynamic content – for example, in a custom section that highlights a specific collection, you could allow the merchant to pick a collection via the section settings, then in Liquid do:
{% for product in collections[section.settings.collection].products limit:4 %}
  <!-- custom markup for product card -->
  <div class="product-card">
    <a href="{{ product.url }}">
      <img src="{{ product | image_url: width: 400 }}" alt="{{ product.title }}">
      <h3>{{ product.title }}</h3>
    </a>
  </div>
{% endfor %}
This loops through products and outputs a simple card. You would style .product-card in CSS. By using Liquid, the content stays dynamic (if the merchant updates that collection’s items, the homepage updates automatically, for instance).
Schema for Sections: Each custom section .liquid file should have a {% schema %} at the bottom that defines settings and blocks. Define user-friendly settings for anything the client might tweak:
Text content (like section headings or subtitles) – use a type: text or textarea setting.
Images – type: image_picker.
Select dropdowns for options (e.g., light/dark variant) if needed.
Blocks if the section is repeatable (e.g., a section “Logo Bar” might allow multiple logo images as blocks, or an FAQ section might allow multiple Q&A blocks).
Example schema (simplified) for a Hero section:
{% schema %}
{
  "name": "Hero Banner",
  "settings": [
    { "id": "background_image", "type": "image_picker", "label": "Background Image" },
    { "id": "heading_text", "type": "text", "label": "Heading Text", "default": "Welcome to Lillier" },
    { "id": "subtext", "type": "textarea", "label": "Subheading Text", "default": "Curated marketplace for Black-owned products." },
    { "id": "cta_label", "type": "text", "label": "Button Label", "default": "Shop Now" },
    { "id": "cta_link", "type": "url", "label": "Button Link", "default": "/collections/all" }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}
In the section HTML above this schema, you’d output these settings with Liquid, e.g. <h1>{{ section.settings.heading_text }}</h1> and a button with {{ section.settings.cta_label }}. This makes the hero content easily editable in the Theme Editor sidebar. Do similar for each custom section.
Third-Party Integrations (Shopify): Consider any apps or external code needed:
Analytics (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel) – Shopify allows adding these via admin (Preferences). If using GA4, you might need to paste the GA4 snippet into theme.liquid head. We’ll cover more in SEO/analytics section.
Review app if needed (for product reviews, Shopify has a free app that embeds stars and forms; if part of site’s plan, integrate and ensure it fits design).
If any special functionality like a wishlist or loyalty program is needed for “repeat use”, plan to integrate an app (and possibly surface it as an icon in header). These typically inject code via script tags or require a snippet in theme – follow the app’s instructions and test styling integration.
Quality Assurance: Use Shopify’s preview and inspector. Check that Liquid logic covers edge cases (e.g., if a setting is left blank, does the section hide gracefully?). Check for translations or multi-currency if relevant (Shopify has those capabilities if expansion is planned). Also test the site in various browsers – ensure no layout shifts or console errors from your JS.
4.6 Performance Optimizations (Shopify): A fast site is important for user experience and SEO:
Dawn is quite optimized out of the box, with lazy loading images and minimal JS. Ensure that any custom images you add (like in hero sections) use Shopify’s built-in image filters to resize appropriately (e.g., use image_url with width params as shown above) so you’re not loading huge images on mobile unnecessarily.
Remove any unnecessary JavaScript from Dawn that you don’t need. For example, if you removed a slideshow section but Dawn’s JS still initializes it, you can safely remove that part from theme.js to lighten the load.
Use Shopify’s theme analyzer or Lighthouse to check performance. Aim to keep LCP low by having optimized images and not too many blocking scripts.
Leverage Shopify CDN for all assets (CSS/JS are served from Shopify, which is fine; any custom library you use, try to also host it or use a fast CDN link).
If you have long pages (like maybe a long editorial article), consider enabling built-in lazy loading for images (just add loading="lazy" if not already present via Liquid).
Mobile optimizations: on mobile, ensure tap targets (buttons, links) are appropriately sized. Also double-check that any custom fonts you use are loaded efficiently (preferably via Shopify’s font library or a CDN, and preconnect to the font source in <head> if external).
5. SEO, Analytics, and Performance Strategy
Both sites should be optimized for search engines, have analytics tracking, and deliver fast performance. Key considerations for each: SEO Best Practices (Both Sites):
Semantic HTML: Ensure that the structure of pages uses proper headings (<h1> for the page title, <h2> for sections, etc.) and that any custom code does not break this hierarchy. On Squarespace, much of this is handled by the template (e.g., page title is an <h1> by default). In custom code blocks, use semantic tags (e.g., <section>, <article> for blog posts, etc.) to improve SEO and accessibility.
Meta Tags: Squarespace allows editing page title and description in page settings – do this for each major page (especially the homepage, with a strong meta description containing keywords about education platform for Black/Brown/queer entrepreneurs). Shopify will automatically use the product or page title and description for meta tags, but you can customize them in the Shopify admin for each page/product (there’s an SEO section for each resource). Double-check that your Shopify theme outputs the {{ page.meta_description }} and other SEO tags in <head> (Dawn typically does) and include og: Open Graph tags and twitter:card tags for social sharing. If not present, add them in theme.liquid using Liquid tags for title, description, product images, etc.
URL Structure: Use clean, descriptive URLs. Squarespace generates URLs from page titles – choose short but meaningful page names. For blog posts or courses, use the collection settings to define a proper URL format (e.g., /blog/post-title). In Shopify, organize products into collections and avoid deep nesting in navigation to keep URLs user-friendly. Both platforms produce a sitemap (Squarespace auto-generates one at yoursite.com/sitemap.xml, Shopify at /sitemap.xml) – submit these to Google Search Console when live.
Structured Data: Shopify’s Dawn includes JSON-LD structured data for products (for rich results like price, availability). If you significantly altered product templates, ensure to keep that snippet (often in snippets/product-meta.liquid or integrated into theme.liquid). For Squarespace, you might rely on its built-in SEO (which might not output JSON-LD for content pages). If C+B has articles, consider adding an Article schema JSON-LD via code injection on blog posts pages for rich snippets (optional but nice). Ensure each image has alt text (client should be advised to add alt text in Squarespace image blocks; in Shopify, alt text is added per image in product media).
Content Strategy: Although not purely development, note that fresh content (blog posts on C+B, perhaps a “Journal” on Lillier highlighting Black-owned brands) will aid SEO. The dev role here is to ensure the blog is set up and easily usable. Encourage the client to use these sections.
Analytics Integration:
Google Analytics (GA): Both platforms support adding GA. For Squarespace, you can input a Google Analytics Tracking ID in Settings, or if using GA4, you might need to add the GA4 snippet via Code Injection (Squarespace’s settings may still only have UA field, so inserting the GA4 <script> in header injection is a way
). On Shopify, in Online Store > Preferences, there is a field for Google Analytics (including a checkbox for using GA4 now, or you can paste the GA4 global site tag). Use that for basic page tracking. If e-commerce tracking is desired, Shopify can also send purchase data to GA (enable “Use Enhanced eCommerce” in Shopify’s preferences and in GA settings).
Additional Analytics/Tracking: If the client needs Facebook Pixel, TikTok Pixel, etc., insert those via code injection on Squarespace and via Shopify’s preferences or theme code. Shopify’s preferences allow a Facebook Pixel ID natively. For other scripts, you can paste them into the theme.liquid just above </head> or in the Google Tag Manager (GTM) field if using GTM.
Testing analytics: After adding, use GA’s real-time reports or Pixel Helper extensions to ensure data is flowing. Also, for membership conversions on C+B, you might want to track sign-ups: with Outseta, you might rely on Outseta’s internal metrics, but you could fire a GA event when the signup modal is confirmed (if Outseta provides a JS callback/hook, you can use that in your custom JS to trigger gtag('event', 'signup', ...)). For Lillier, Shopify will handle purchase conversion tracking if GA is set up.
Performance and SEO (Combined Consideration):
Fast Loading: Search ranking benefits from fast sites. We already discussed optimizing theme code and media. Also implement caching where possible: Squarespace pages are served via their CDN – just avoid heavy client-side rendering. Shopify pages are mostly server-rendered and cached via CDN as well. Keep custom JavaScript lightweight to not hurt Time-to-Interactive.
Image Optimization: Both Squarespace and Shopify will serve images in optimized ways if used correctly. In Squarespace, when you upload images to an Image Block or Gallery, it will generate responsive versions. If you use a custom code <img> (e.g., in a code block for the hero), use the Squarespace responsive image URLs (you can get the URL of an uploaded image and add ?format=1500w for example to get a specific width). On Shopify, always use the | image_url filter with size parameters or | image_tag which includes srcset by default for responsive images. This ensures mobile gets smaller images.
Lazy Loading & Priority: For off-screen images (like further down the homepage), use lazy loading. Shopify does this out of the box for product grids. For any custom code images, add loading="lazy" attribute. For Squarespace, images in code blocks won’t lazy load by default, so you might consider a JS IntersectionObserver to load them or just accept initial load if few. Prioritize above-the-fold content in your HTML output order (especially on Shopify: e.g., hero text should be in HTML, not solely in an image).
SEO Audits: Before launch, run an SEO audit tool or Lighthouse. Check for any missing meta tags, broken links, etc. Also ensure each page has only one H1, alt attributes on all images, and so on.
Accessibility: This goes hand-in-hand with SEO and is important for the audience. Use accessible markup (labels on forms, aria labels if needed for icons, sufficient color contrast between text and background as per WCAG). Test with screen readers or accessibility checkers (Shopify’s theme analyzer, Chrome’s Lighthouse accessibility tests). This will benefit all users and ensure the sites are inclusive.
6. Handoff Strategy and Client Editability
A smooth handoff ensures the client team can maintain and grow the sites without breaking the design. Both Squarespace and Shopify are chosen for their user-friendly content management, so we need to maximize that strength: Editable Components on Squarespace (C+B):
After building the C+B site, prepare a short training for the client on using Squarespace’s editor. Highlight how they can add new pages or edit text without touching code. For example, if the homepage hero text is in a Code Block (HTML), the client would need to edit it in code view – which might be intimidating. To mitigate this, consider alternatives:
Could the hero text be a normal Squarespace Text Block overlaid on a banner? If not, and code is the only way, provide clear comments in the Code Block HTML like <!-- Hero Heading start --> and instructions in documentation on what to change.
Perhaps simpler: use Squarespace’s built-in Banner image and title for the page if it can achieve a similar effect, then you wouldn’t need custom code for just text. Custom code can then be limited to things that don’t require frequent changes.
Member Content Management: If using Member Areas, show the client how to tag pages as members-only and how to manage member lists. If using Outseta, train them on using Outseta’s dashboard (checking subscriptions, etc.) and emphasize that content gating rules are mostly set-and-forget in the code you added.
Adding Blog Posts/Articles: Ensure the blog is configured. Show them how to add a new post, and note that your CSS will automatically format it in the designed style. If there are any special classes they need to use (e.g., a CSS class to style a pull-quote in an article), document this in a guide. For instance, “to highlight a quote, wrap it in a <span class="pullquote"> via the code editor in the post body”.
Adding New Pages: If they want to add a new public page, they can do so through Squarespace normally. Your global CSS will style headings, paragraphs, etc., to match the design. If they need a fancy layout on that page, they have two options: use built-in sections/blocks (which your global styles have refined), or copy an existing Code Block from another page. Provide a few “template” code snippets in documentation – for example, give them a ready-made code for a two-column image/text section they can paste if needed.
Limitations: Caution the client that moving to Squarespace 7.1 meant we integrated custom code that should remain in place. For example, advise them not to disable code injection and not to remove certain code blocks that are critical. If they do, functionality could break. Mark important code blocks in the Squarespace editor with an HTML comment like <!-- Do not remove: custom hero section start --> so even if someone opens it later, they know it’s not default content.
Documentation: Provide a short guide (1-2 pages) listing the custom code pieces and their purpose, and simple instructions for common tasks (e.g., “To update the homepage hero image, go to Home -> Edit -> find the Code Block at top -> replace the image URL within <img src='...'> or contact developer if unsure”). Also mention any third-party accounts (Outseta login for membership management, etc.) the client will need to maintain.
Editable Components on Shopify (Lillier):
Theme Editor Familiarization: The client should be introduced to Shopify’s Theme Editor, where they can modify the content of the homepage and other section-enabled pages easily. Show them how to add a new section on the homepage, move sections up and down, and edit section settings (like changing text or images using the sidebar controls you built). Emphasize that Online Store 2.0 allows these changes without code
.
Custom Sections Usage: Document each custom section you created:
What it’s for (e.g., “Featured Article Section – to display a blog post excerpt on the homepage”).
Which settings it has (e.g., “you can select which blog article to feature by choosing a tag in the section settings” or however you coded it).
If some sections allow blocks (e.g., an FAQ section with Q&A blocks), explain how to add and reorder those blocks in the editor.
Adding Products/Collections: Provide guidance on managing the store: adding new products, creating collections, and how those appear on the site. For example, if the homepage features the “New Arrivals” collection automatically, let them know updating that collection’s products will update the homepage. If certain collections are used in sections or navigation, ensure they know how to update those references. (You might have set collection handles directly in Liquid if hardcoded, but ideally you used settings to pick them, which they can change.)
Blog Posts on Shopify: If Lillier includes an editorial blog, show how to add a blog post in Shopify and how to get it to show up on site (likely a section on some page). If it’s automatically showing latest, no action needed beyond adding the post. If there’s a curated “editorial picks” section, instruct how to flag or select posts to appear (could be by tag or manual selection in a section).
Menus and Navigation: The header and footer menus should be manageable via Shopify Navigation settings. Ensure any links are not hardcoded in theme (except maybe special ones like account or cart icons). So the client can add a new menu item (e.g., adding a new collection to main menu) via Shopify admin. Test this: if they do add an item, does the header design accommodate it (might need to limit number of items visually)? Document how to do it and any recommendations (like “Stick to short menu labels to maintain the clean look”).
Apps Management: If you installed any Shopify apps (for reviews, wishlist, etc.), let them know how those function. E.g., “We installed Shopify Product Reviews app – you can moderate reviews in the Shopify admin under Apps > Product Reviews. The theme will display reviews stars on product pages automatically if any exist.” This helps them maintain those features.
No-Code Customizations: Encourage the client to use theme settings for minor style tweaks rather than editing code. For instance, if they want to change a font or color later, they can go to Theme Settings and do so (assuming we exposed those settings). If something more drastic is needed, they can duplicate the theme and try edits or hire a dev – but on day-to-day, the theme editor suffices. Reassure them that adding new content (products, pages, blog posts) is intended to be code-free.
Final Handoff Checklist:
Access and Ownership: On Squarespace, transfer the site ownership or ensure the client’s account has proper roles to edit content and code injection (they’ll need a Business plan to retain code injection abilities). On Shopify, transfer the dev store to the client’s account (if you built it under a Partner account, use the Transfer ownership feature). This will prompt them to pick a plan.
Testing with Client: Walk through key tasks with the client (possibly a live demo): e.g., add a dummy blog post on C+B, change a hero image on Lillier, go through the purchase flow on Lillier to show orders coming into Shopify admin, and a membership sign-up on C+B to show how a new member is recorded.
Post-launch Support: Mention that you’ll be available for a stabilizing period to fix any issues that come up (like if any custom code has an unforeseen bug or if the client is unsure how to do something). Also note that for Shopify, updating the theme in the future will be manual (since it’s custom, they won’t click “upgrade” like an app, they’d integrate changes by code). Advise them to refrain from editing theme code directly without knowledge; instead, use the customization options provided or consult a developer for changes.
By following this plan, we ensure both Cupcakes+Broccoli and Lillier are built with robust custom code integrated into their respective platforms in a maintainable way. The design system keeps them visually cohesive, each platform’s strengths are utilized (Squarespace for content/membership, Shopify for commerce), and the client will be empowered to manage content and pages easily after handoff. Both sites will be ready for expansion – whether adding more courses on C+B or more products on Lillier – without needing significant redevelopment, thanks to the flexible, section-based architecture and solid groundwork.

How I do develop the two sites simultaneously as much as possible from a single code base? If we want style and form to mirror across the two as much as possible, with tweaks to each to represent their unique attributes, then in order to avoid doing double work, despite the two different platforms - wouldn't it make the most sense to develop from a single code base initially, and carry that as far as possible? Please show me how we could cleanly accomplish this to further our development on both sites simultaneously and avoid additional unnecessary work. Thanks.

Thought for 2m 34s
Yes — the clean way to “build once, ship twice” here is to treat Squarespace + Shopify as two renderers sitting on top of a shared design system + shared front-end layer (tokens, CSS, JS behaviors, component specs). That directly matches the brief: experiential cohesion, not platform unification 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

, while still delivering a shared design system 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 and CMS-driven builds 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

.

Below is a practical setup that avoids double work.

What you can realistically share (and what you can’t)
Share (this is where you save the time)
Design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing, radii) → generate both CSS variables and LESS variables.

Base CSS + component CSS (buttons, cards, nav, grids, typography rhythm) aligned to the “editorial / minimal / mobile-first” constraints 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

.

JS behaviors (nav drawer, tabs, accordions, modal, sticky header, search UI patterns). Same JS runs on both sites.

Component “specs” (a neutral template for each component) → output to:

Shopify: Liquid snippets/sections

Squarespace: HTML fragments for Code Blocks + CSS that styles native blocks

Can’t fully share
Shopify’s data templating (Liquid loops over products/collections/metafields) has no equivalent in Squarespace.

Squarespace’s editor-native block markup is not the same as Shopify’s sections.

So: you share the system + presentation layer, then do light mapping per platform.

The monorepo pattern that works
Create one repo with a shared package and two “apps”:

repo/
  packages/
    design-system/
      tokens/
        tokens.json
      src/
        tokens.css        # generated
        tokens.less       # generated
        base.css
        components/
          button.css
          card.css
          nav.css
        behaviors/
          nav.js
          tabs.js
          accordions.js
      build/
        build.mjs         # generates outputs
  apps/
    shopify-theme/        # Dawn-based theme
      assets/
      sections/
      snippets/
      layout/theme.liquid
    squarespace/
      snippets/           # HTML fragments to paste into Code Blocks
      injection/
        header.html       # what you paste into SS header injection
        footer.html       # what you paste into SS footer injection
Output strategy (key idea)
Build produces 2 bundles from the same source:

dist/cb.css + dist/cb.js (Cupcakes+Broccoli “theme variant”)

dist/lillier.css + dist/lillier.js (Lillier “theme variant”)

Both are 90% identical; only a small override layer differs.

Step 1 — Make the shared design tokens the single source of truth
packages/design-system/tokens/tokens.json (example)

{
  "color": {
    "bg": "#ffffff",
    "text": "#0b0b0b",
    "muted": "#6b6b6b",
    "border": "#e7e7e7",
    "accent": "#ff2d55"
  },
  "space": { "1": "4px", "2": "8px", "3": "12px", "4": "16px", "6": "24px", "8": "32px", "12": "48px" },
  "radius": { "sm": "8px", "md": "14px", "lg": "22px" },
  "type": {
    "fontBody": "system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Arial",
    "fontDisplay": "system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Arial",
    "sizeBase": "16px",
    "lhBase": "1.45"
  }
}
Then create two tiny brand override files:

brands/cb.json and brands/lillier.json that only override color.accent, maybe fontDisplay, etc.

This supports the “shared DNA but different usage patterns” requirement 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

.

Step 2 — Generate CSS variables + LESS from tokens
In build/build.mjs, generate:

dist/tokens.css:

:root { --color-bg: ...; --space-4: ... }

dist/tokens.less:

@color-bg: ...; @space-4: ...

Why: Squarespace Custom CSS supports LESS variables; Shopify is happier with CSS variables.

Step 3 — Build shared CSS once, then “theme” it twice
Structure:

shared.css imports tokens + base + components

cb.css = shared.css + cb-overrides.css

lillier.css = shared.css + lillier-overrides.css

Example:

/* shared.css */
@import "./tokens.css";
@import "./base.css";
@import "./components/button.css";
@import "./components/card.css";
@import "./components/nav.css";
/* cb-overrides.css */
:root { --color-accent: #ff2d55; }
/* lillier-overrides.css */
:root { --color-accent: #5a2cff; }
Now both sites automatically stay aligned to the same editorial rhythm and mobile cleanliness 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

.

Step 4 — Make JS behaviors shared + “DOM-adapter” per platform
Write JS that expects stable, your attributes:

data-cnb-nav-toggle

data-cnb-accordion

data-cnb-tabs

Then add a tiny adapter that “finds” Squarespace/Shopify elements and adds those attributes/classes.

Example: adapter pattern
// behaviors/adapter.js
export function adaptSquarespace() {
  // Example: turn Squarespace button blocks into your button class
  document.querySelectorAll('.sqs-block-button-element').forEach(btn => {
    btn.classList.add('cnb-btn');
  });
}

export function adaptShopify() {
  // Example: ensure Shopify add-to-cart button gets your class
  document.querySelectorAll('form[action*="/cart/add"] button[type="submit"]').forEach(btn => {
    btn.classList.add('cnb-btn');
  });
}
In your entry:

import { adaptSquarespace, adaptShopify } from './adapter.js';
import { initNav } from './nav.js';
import { initAccordions } from './accordions.js';

export function boot(brand) {
  if (brand === 'cb') adaptSquarespace();
  if (brand === 'lillier') adaptShopify();
  initNav();
  initAccordions();
}
This is the big unlock: you keep one JS codebase, only the adapters differ.

Step 5 — Shipping the same built assets into both platforms
Shopify (Lillier): copy build outputs into theme assets
Your build script copies:

dist/lillier.css → apps/shopify-theme/assets/lillier.css

dist/lillier.js → apps/shopify-theme/assets/lillier.js

Then in apps/shopify-theme/layout/theme.liquid, add these (exactly where Dawn normally loads CSS/JS):

<head>
  {{ 'base.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
  {{ 'lillier.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
</head>
<body class="brand-lillier">
  ...
  {{ 'lillier.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
</body>
Squarespace (C+B): load the built assets via injection
Squarespace is easiest if you host the built files somewhere you control (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, S3+CloudFront). Then you paste just references into Squarespace Code Injection.

Header injection (so CSS vars apply before paint):

<script>document.documentElement.classList.add('brand-cb');</script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-cdn.example.com/cb.css">
Footer injection:

<script src="https://your-cdn.example.com/cb.js" defer></script>
<script>
  window.CNB && window.CNB.boot && window.CNB.boot('cb');
</script>
This gives you true single-source deployment: rebuild once → both sites update.

If the client insists on “no external hosting,” you can still use one codebase, but your last step becomes:

copy/paste cb.css into Squarespace Custom CSS (manual),

keep Shopify automated.
You still avoid double development work; only publishing is manual.

Step 6 — “Component once” workflow that still stays client-editable
Because the client must be able to add/edit pages easily 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

, your shared system should prioritize:

Shopify
Components become Sections and Snippets (editable via Theme Editor).

Squarespace
Components become (a) native blocks styled by your CSS + adapter, or (b) small Code Blocks for only the pieces Squarespace can’t do.

A good rule:

80%: style native Squarespace blocks (text, image, buttons, summaries) so the client edits without code.

20%: code blocks for unique layouts (hero, custom AI tool UI).

This supports “CMS-driven builds” and “long-term scalability” 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 without sacrificing your custom-code preference.

Step 7 — Keep “shared form” without copying templates: use a mapping sheet
Create a simple internal mapping like:

Hero

Shopify: sections/hero.liquid

Squarespace: Section with Image + Text blocks OR code snippet squarespace/snippets/hero.html

Card Grid

Shopify: collection loop snippet

Squarespace: Summary Block styled as .cnb-grid

Editorial Article List

Shopify: blog section

Squarespace: Blog list page styled

This is how you stay aligned to “shared design system, different intents” 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 without trying to force identical templating.

The day-to-day dev loop (fast + simultaneous)
Run these in parallel:

Design-system watch build

rebuilds CSS/JS on change

copies Lillier outputs into Shopify theme assets

rebuilds C+B outputs to CDN folder (or just dist folder)

Shopify CLI dev server

shopify theme dev for live theme preview

Squarespace staging site

you don’t get local runtime, so you iterate by:

using a local “playground” HTML page to validate CSS/JS fast

pushing updates to CDN

refreshing the staging Squarespace site

This gives you one codebase and one “UI truth,” with Shopify + Squarespace as delivery targets.

If you want, I can give you the exact scripts
If you tell me what you want to use for the repo (pnpm vs npm) and where you’d prefer to host the shared assets (Cloudflare Pages vs Netlify vs S3), I’ll write:

the exact folder structure,

the package.json scripts,

a working build.mjs that generates tokens + bundles CSS/JS,

the exact Liquid + Squarespace injection snippets ready to paste.

Here's another question for you. I know this client from experience, and in the past she wanted to implement her own shopify page as a collection of a thousand other independent seller sites. She wanted to somehow have 1) all the inventory from those thousand sites present on her single consolidated shopfiy site, and 2) have orders placed through her site go through to the respective independent seller(s). How is this possible with a minimum amount of headache? I need your creativity and planning ability to architect an elegant solution.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 3m 10s
What she’s describing is a marketplace / dropship-aggregator: one “front door” (Lillier on Shopify) that lets customers check out once, while fulfillment + inventory live with many independent sellers. That fits Lillier’s intent (“daily, one-stop-shop marketplace… transactional e-commerce… designed for scale”) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

.

There are only a few realistic ways to do it without pain. Here’s the elegant architecture I’d push, with a phased rollout that keeps complexity under control.

The lowest-headache “best case”: all sellers are Shopify stores → Shopify Collective
If the sellers are already on Shopify (or can move there), Shopify Collective is almost literally built for this:

You import products from supplier Shopify stores into your Shopify store 

Inventory syncs in real time across connected stores 

When a customer checks out, the order is automatically split and routed to the relevant supplier stores 

Suppliers fulfill + ship direct to the customer, and tracking syncs back to your store 

Payments between retailer/supplier are handled within the system 

It’s available only for supported countries/currencies + eligibility rules 

Why this is “minimum headache”: it avoids custom inventory sync, custom order splitting, and custom vendor payout logic because Shopify already orchestrates it. You’re mainly doing curation + UX + merchandising, which aligns with “Amazon built by someone with taste” 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

.

Catch: Collective only works with Shopify-to-Shopify suppliers (and eligibility). So you need a plan for the non-Shopify long tail.

The “mixed world” solution (most realistic): Two-tier supplier model
You keep one Shopify storefront, but you support suppliers via two integration tracks:

Track A — Shopify suppliers (preferred)
Onboard them via Shopify Collective (fastest, lowest ops) 

Track B — Non-Shopify suppliers (long tail)
Use a lightweight order/inventory hub to normalize data and route orders. The cleanest low-code hub I’ve seen for this pattern is Order Desk:

It can import Shopify orders and split by vendor 

It can route each split order to a vendor via rules (email/API style flows) 

This creates a simple “vendor integration contract”:

Either connect via Collective (Shopify vendors)

Or provide a feed/API that Order Desk can ingest, and accept orders via email/API workflow

This hybrid approach is elegant because you don’t build 1,000 custom integrations. You build one vendor onboarding pipeline with two supported paths.

How to make “all inventory present” without losing your mind
You need a strict data model + onboarding rules, otherwise 1,000 catalogs becomes chaos.

1) Normalize every product into a single schema
Minimum required fields (enforced):

vendor_id (internal)

vendor_name (maps to Shopify “Vendor” field)

vendor_sku and a normalized SKU (recommend prefixing: V123-<vendor_sku>)

title, images, price, compare_at (optional), category/tags

fulfillment_profile (lead time, shipping regions, carrier rules)

return_policy_code

2) Choose your “source of truth” for inventory
Collective suppliers: supplier store is truth; inventory sync is handled 

Non-Shopify suppliers: pick one:

Vendor is truth → they push inventory updates (feed/API), you mirror into Shopify on schedule

Your hub is truth → Order Desk holds inventory + availability rules, you keep Shopify quantities conservative to prevent oversell

For “minimum headache,” I’d do Vendor-is-truth with scheduled updates.

3) Import products into Shopify
Collective: import inside Shopify (easy) 

Non-Shopify: bulk import (CSV) or Admin API (later), but enforce SKU rules so you never collide.

How to make “orders placed on Lillier go to the right seller(s)”
There are two practical routing patterns:

Pattern 1 — Use “already built” routing (simplest)
Collective handles routing for Shopify suppliers automatically 

Order Desk splits Shopify orders by vendor and routes them 

That’s the lowest headache stack.

Pattern 2 — Custom routing app (only if you must)
Shopify’s fulfillment architecture supports splitting by line items and quantities:

Fulfillment orders represent groups of items to be fulfilled from the same location 

There’s an Admin GraphQL mutation to split fulfillment orders (fulfillmentOrderSplit) 

Shopify can also split shipments automatically across fulfillment locations in some cases 

But: doing “one vendor = one Shopify location” doesn’t scale well to 1,000 vendors. So if you custom-build, you typically:

store vendor routing in metafields

listen to orders/create webhooks

create “sub-orders” in your own DB

notify vendors + collect tracking

update fulfillments back into Shopify via Admin API

This is doable, but it’s more headache than Order Desk unless you’re building a serious marketplace platform.

Recommended “elegant” rollout plan (keeps complexity contained)
Phase 1: Launch with Shopify-only suppliers (fast, polished)
Build Lillier’s UX, taxonomy, search, editorial merchandising

Onboard initial brands via Collective so inventory/routing is automated 

You get multi-brand checkout with order routing, minimal ops 

Phase 2: Add the long tail via a hub (Order Desk)
Define vendor integration contract (feed format + order notification format)

Implement “Split by Vendor” in the hub and route orders 

Start with the simplest fulfillment comms (vendor emails + portal link), then API later

Phase 3: If scale demands it, swap the hub for a heavier OMS (optional)
If she actually gets to hundreds/thousands of active sellers with real volume, you may outgrow lightweight routing and need a more formal OMS/orchestration layer (Pipe17 positions itself as order ops orchestration) 
. Only do this when volume justifies it.

If she insists on a “true marketplace” (vendors log in, manage inventory, payouts)
Then you’re in multi-vendor marketplace app territory on Shopify (vendors manage listings inside your store). Examples:

Webkul MultiVendor Marketplace (vendor tooling, payouts, integrations) 

Puppet Vendors (vendor portal + commissions/payouts) 

Garnet Multivendor Marketplace (split orders/payouts) 

This can work, but it’s a different operating model: vendors are “tenants” inside your Shopify instance, and you still have the complexity of tax/shipping/returns/payout operations.

The single most important decision (that determines headache level)
Before building anything, lock one policy choice:

Are you the merchant of record (customer pays you, you pay vendors), or are you just referring customers out?

If she wants “one checkout,” you’re basically merchant of record (Collective automates the supplier payment flow in that specific model) 

If she’s flexible, the absolute minimum headache is “curated catalog + link out,” but that’s not what she asked for.

If you tell me which world she’s actually in (even roughly):

“Most sellers are on Shopify already” vs “Most are random sites,” and

“She wants one checkout no matter what” vs “She’s open to link-outs for some vendors,”

…I’ll give you a concrete blueprint with:

exact data model (metafields/tags),

vendor onboarding flow,

the operational playbook (inventory cadence, tracking capture),

and either the Collective-first implementation checklist or the Order Desk hub configuration plan.

Does shopify collective require the other vendors to do anything? Or can we just pull in their inventory from our end? That's all we want, is for their inventory to be searchable, sortable, shoppable as part of our own page's collection. Without them having to opt in.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12s
No — you can’t just “pull in” other vendors’ inventory into Shopify Collective unilaterally.

What Shopify Collective actually requires
To use Collective, the supplier side has to participate in some way:

A supplier must connect with you (either they invite you, or you invite them and they accept). 

Suppliers share products via price lists (private or public), and retailers import from those lists. 

Shopify explicitly frames it as “stores on Shopify team up,” starting with an invitation to connect and a price list. 

Is there any way to import without supplier approval?
Only in one limited scenario: public price lists.

Shopify notes that some suppliers create public price lists that let eligible retailers “instantly import products… without having to connect with or be approved by the supplier.” 

But that still requires the supplier to:

be on Shopify,

be using Collective,

and intentionally publish a public price list.

It’s not a “scrape any store” feature, and it won’t help with “a thousand independent seller sites” unless they’re already opted into Collective.

If your real requirement is “searchable + shoppable catalog without vendor opt-in”
Then Collective is the wrong tool. You’re describing one of these:

Option A — Affiliate/Referral marketplace (lowest headache)
You index product listings from independent sites (manually, feeds, or limited crawling)

“Add to cart” sends users to the vendor site (or opens vendor checkout)

You earn affiliate commission (where available)

✅ Minimal operations, no order routing, no returns/payout headaches
❌ Not a single checkout; less “owned” commerce experience

Option B — True marketplace with vendor onboarding (still reasonable)
You do need vendor consent, but you make it painless:

Vendor provides a feed (CSV/Google Sheet/API) OR connects their Shopify

Your store imports the catalog and routes orders back to them

This is where Shopify Collective (for Shopify vendors) + an order-routing hub (for non-Shopify vendors) becomes the “minimum headache” architecture.

Option C — Build your own inventory/order aggregator (highest headache)
You create integrations per vendor (feeds, APIs)

You create order splitting + vendor notifications + tracking ingestion

You manage payment splits / vendor payouts

This is doable, but it’s the opposite of “minimum headache.”

Practical recommendation you can tell the client
If she wants shoppable inventory inside her Shopify with “place order on my site”:

Require opt-in via one of two vendor paths:

Shopify vendors: join via Collective invitation / signup link 

Non-Shopify vendors: provide a simple product feed + accept orders via a standardized process

If she insists on no vendor opt-in, the honest answer is:

you can only do an index + link-out model, not true “checkout on our site,” without creating legal/ops chaos.

If you tell me which of these she’ll accept:

single checkout is mandatory vs link-outs acceptable, and

how many vendors are already on Shopify,

…I’ll lay out the cleanest implementation path (vendor onboarding contract + catalog structure + how you keep it searchable/sortable on Shopify without killing yourself operationally).

You said:
Ok assuming we have the shopify site URL but not the contact info for a few hundred shopify sellers: how do we automate the discovery of their contact info? We cannot afford the time to look up each one individually.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 37s
You can’t reliably “discover” contact info that a merchant hasn’t made public. What you can automate (legitimately) is: extract whatever business contact + social links they already publish, at scale, from the handful of Shopify pages that are very often present.

Here’s the lowest-headache approach I’d use.

1) First choice: use Shopify Collective’s built-in Discovery (when possible)
If you’re eligible for Shopify Collective as a retailer, Collective has a Discovery feature to find suppliers and it explicitly exposes “key supplier details… and contact information more easily” (Shopify changelog). 

How to leverage this with only store URLs:

For each store URL, programmatically fetch the homepage title/brand name.

Use that name to search in Apps → Collective → Discovery. 

When it matches, you’ll often get the contact/social details right there. 

This avoids scraping and tends to be cleaner if the supplier participates in Collective.

2) The practical automation: crawl the “standard Shopify pages” and extract public contact info
Shopify stores commonly publish contact details in:

a contact page (often .../pages/contact) (you’ll see Shopify’s own example thank-you URL format using /pages/contact?...). 

policy pages that have standardized URLs Shopify documents (privacy/terms/refund/shipping). 

So your automation pipeline is:

Step A — For each store domain, try these URLs (in order)
/pages/contact and /contact 

/policies/privacy-policy

/policies/terms-of-service

/policies/refund-policy

/policies/shipping-policy 

Step B — Parse the HTML for:
mailto: links

visible emails (regex)

phone patterns

“sameAs” social links in JSON-LD (application/ld+json) (Instagram is often the fastest path to reach them)

the actual contact page URL if it’s linked in the footer/nav

Step C — Output a CSV with:
store domain

emails found (if any)

phone (if any)

contact page found (URL)

policy pages found (Y/N)

instagram/facebook/tiktok links

status (ok / blocked / none found)

Guardrails (important)
Only collect what’s publicly displayed on their site.

Rate-limit hard (don’t hammer sites) and respect robots.txt where possible.

Expect a chunk to be “no public email” (many merchants use forms only).

3) A ready-to-run script (public-info extraction only)
Create a file discover_contacts.py and run it against a text file of URLs.

                row["found_on"] = url
                break

        row["status"] = "ok" if (row["emails"] or row["phones"] or row["instagram"] or row["contact_link"]) else "none_found"

        w = csv.DictWriter(out, fieldnames=rows[0].keys())
        w.writeheader()
        w.writerows(rows)

    print("Wrote vendor_contacts.csv")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This script:

only checks a few very common pages (including Shopify’s standardized policy URLs). 

grabs emails/phones/social links if they’re public

produces vendor_contacts.csv

4) When emails aren’t public (very common): use socials + a single onboarding link
When a store has no published email, your best automation isn’t “find email anyway” — it’s:

pull Instagram / TikTok / Facebook links (often present in footer or JSON-LD)

send a short DM asking them to opt into your supplier program

include one onboarding link (ex: “apply / connect your store”)

If you use Collective, Shopify explicitly supports inviting suppliers, but it still needs an email for an invite flow. 

So socials become your “no-email” channel.

5) Reality check on success rate
With a few hundred Shopify stores, expect something like:

40–70%: some public contact method (email or form or social)

10–30%: only a contact form (no email)

10–20%: minimal info + aggressive bot protection

That’s why “public extraction + social fallback + Collective Discovery where possible” is the clean combo. 

If you want, paste 5–10 example store URLs (just domains, no private info) and I’ll tell you which paths tend to work best for that cohort (some niches lean harder on policy pages; some always have email in the footer).

Thought for 1m 56s
Below is a “kickoff questionnaire” you can run (email or live call). It’s tailored to what the brief actually commits to: two standalone sites that share a unified design system, Squarespace for C+B and Shopify for Lillier, CMS-driven, with C+B subscriptions + member resources + an AI tool, Lillier full e-commerce, and SEO/analytics baked in, all mobile-first with an editorial / chic feel and subtle shared DNA (not overt). 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


1) Scope, phasing, and what “launch” actually means
The brief calls out a phased launch plan and a March 1, 2026 target. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


What is Phase 1 vs Phase 2 for each site (must-have at launch vs can ship later)?

For launch, what are the top 3 user actions you want to optimize for on each site? (C+B: subscribe / take class / use AI tool; Lillier: search / add-to-cart / repeat purchase—confirm.) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


What are the success metrics you’ll use on day 1 and day 30? (The brief defines success qualitatively—confirm quantitative KPIs.) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Who needs to sign off at each milestone (IA, design system, templates, prelaunch QA)? The brief says feedback is centralized under Amanda. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


What’s the budget tolerance for paid apps/plugins (Shopify apps, Squarespace member/subscription add-ons, video hosting, etc.) given the overall budget constraint? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


2) Domains, brand relationship, and how the two sites “touch”
The brief explicitly wants “experiential cohesion, not platform unification.” 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


What are the exact domains for each brand? (Do they already exist? Who controls registrar/DNS?)

Do you want a parent landing page that routes to both brands (like the brief’s example of a “landing page that points to both companies”)? Where should it live and what should the URL be? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


How do you want cross-navigation handled:

hard links in nav, subtle footer links, or only occasional editorial links? (Brief: “subtle and embedded, not overt.”) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Should accounts/logins be totally separate (likely yes), and do you want any shared email capture / shared CRM behind the scenes?

3) Content inventory and who supplies what (copy, photos, structure)
The brief is clear that photography and imagery quality will drive impact. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Do you already have final copy for core pages? If not, who is writing it and by when?

Do you already have high-caliber photography selected/shot? If not, what’s the plan and timeline? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Do you have a content map (page list + what lives on each page) for both sites? If not, can we workshop a first draft together?

What content needs to be editable by the client often (weekly) vs rarely (quarterly)?

Any existing sites we must migrate content from (even if ugly), including redirects?

4) Shared design system questions (so you can build once, apply twice)
The brief requires a shared visual system: strong typography, whitespace, rhythm, premium but calm, mobile-first. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Are there any locked brand elements beyond logos (fonts, colors, tone rules)? (Logos are locked. Anything else?) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Do you have a preferred typeface set already licensed, or should we propose options?

Do you want a shared pattern/texture system inspired by the CAMO reference (pattern as structure), and where is pattern allowed vs forbidden? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Confirm “what to avoid” in practical UI terms: promotions? badges? busy tiles? (Brief lists anti-patterns like “templated,” “dense UI,” “SaaS dashboards.”) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


For each brand, what are the allowed “tweaks” that differentiate them while keeping shared DNA? (e.g., spacing + typography same; accent color differs; photography treatment differs.)

5) Information architecture and navigation (mobile-first)
Both sites hinge on navigation clarity (classes/tools/resources for C+B; search/taxonomy for Lillier). 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


C+B: what are the top-level nav items you expect (Classes, AI Tool, Resources, Dinners, About, Subscribe… confirm)? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Lillier: confirm the category taxonomy (core categories listed—do we need subcategories and filters per category?) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Do you want site search on C+B as well (resources/classes search), or only on Lillier?

Any planned future sections you want the IA to anticipate (so templates scale cleanly)? The brief wants “flexibility for future expansion.” 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


6) Cupcakes + Broccoli specifics (Squarespace + subscription + members + AI tool)
C+B is subscription-based with member-only resources and a “customized AI tool,” plus classes/programming and invite-only dinners. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Subscription + membership
What are the membership tiers, prices, billing period, and what content is gated per tier?

Do you need free trial, promo codes, scholarships, or waitlist?

What’s the cancellation/refund policy and how should that be communicated?

What does “subscriptions should feel like access and belonging, not commerce” mean in practice—do you want no upsell UI after login, minimal pricing surfaces, etc.? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Classes + content delivery
Are classes video-first (MasterClass-like reference), live cohort-based, or mixed? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Where will videos live (Vimeo, YouTube unlisted, native upload), and do members need downloads?

Do you need scheduling, reminders, calendar invites, or just “watch anytime”?

“Customized AI tool”
What does the AI tool do on day 1 (exact user workflow)? Example: intake form → generates plan → saves outputs → follow-ups? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Does it require users to log in and store their inputs/outputs? If yes: retention rules, privacy expectations, and admin moderation?

Do you envision it as: embedded widget page, multi-step guided flow, or a separate app-like experience? (Brief wants “authored, intentional flows” and no dashboard-y UI.) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Blind Dinner Parties (invite-only)
What’s needed online: private landing page, application form, RSVP, member-only invite list, photo recap, press page? 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Who manages invites and guest lists (and what tool do they already use, if any)?

7) Lillier specifics (Shopify + marketplace + scale)
Lillier is positioned as “everyday utility,” “strong navigation, search, and taxonomy,” designed for repeat purchasing and operational growth. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Commerce fundamentals
What’s the expected catalog size at launch (SKUs, variants, collections)?

Are products stocked by Lillier, drop-shipped, or mixed? Who fulfills orders?

Shipping rules: carriers, rates, free-shipping thresholds, regional limitations, international?

Returns/exchanges policy and who handles customer service?

Marketplace reality check (critical, given “one-stop-shop marketplace” framing) 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…

Are you envisioning true multi-vendor (each brand fulfills their own items) or “curated retailer” (Lillier owns checkout + fulfillment)?

If multi-vendor: how will vendor onboarding work—contracts, product data standards, inventory sync cadence, and who resolves inventory conflicts?

What is the desired shopping experience for mixed-vendor carts: single checkout, split shipments, split confirmations?

Search + taxonomy
What filters matter most on mobile: brand, price, category, skin/hair type, ingredients, sustainable flags, etc.? (Decide early so data models are clean.)

Any editorial merchandising needs: curated sets, “shop the edit,” routine builders, replenishment flows?

8) SEO, analytics, and measurement setup
The scope says “SEO and analytics baked in.” 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Do you have existing GA4/Search Console accounts, or should we create new ones (and who owns them)?

Any paid marketing pixels required at launch (Meta, TikTok, Pinterest)?

Target keywords / SEO priorities for each brand (and any competitors to benchmark)?

Do you need structured data (Product schema, Organization, FAQ, Article) and editorial/blog features?

9) Operational / client-editability requirements (your handoff constraint)
The brief expects CMS-driven builds and scalable systems. 
CnB and Lillier Website Brief_J…


Who on the client side will edit pages, add products/classes, and publish content? What’s their comfort level?

What’s the desired “easy to extend” workflow: adding a page from a template, duplicating a section library, editing collections, etc.?

What kind of training/handoff do you want: recorded Looms, written SOPs, or a live walkthrough?

10) Approvals, assets, and access (practical blockers)
Can you grant collaborator access to Squarespace + Shopify + domain registrar + GA4 now?

Where are assets stored (Drive/Dropbox/Figma), and who’s responsible for final delivery?

Any legal pages required (privacy policy, terms, cookie consent) and who provides them?

If you want to send this as one clean message to the client
Tell me:

whether you want it framed as (A) a concise email or (B) a call agenda,
and I’ll format it into something you can copy/paste verbatim.

Here's some further guidance for you on how I should play this. I reached out after reading the full brief and just said basically "hey good to hear from you, I'd love to hear more." The client sent back the following: I’m glad the brief resonated. I want to reassure you that while the vision is ambitious, I’m being very intentional about how this comes together. I am not looking for one person to do everything or to shoulder something overwhelming.
How I’m imagining this is more modular and collaborative. There is a clear design direction and content already being locked, and I’m speaking with design partners for the visual system. Where I think you could be a great fit is on the development and site side, helping bring things to life cleanly, thinking through structure, and potentially acting as an ongoing site partner once things are live.
The March 1 date is a target, but Phase 1 is deliberately scoped. My goal is to build something solid and elegant, not overengineered, and to work with people who feel supported and clear about what they are responsible for.
If you’re open to it, I’d love to do a low-pressure call to walk you through how I’m thinking about roles, scope, and pacing, and hear your honest thoughts. No expectations either way. I really respect your eye and how you work.
And yes, everything here is moving with intention and support, not chaos.

Here’s how I’d “play it” so you come across as confident, structured, and genuinely collaborative—while quietly protecting you from scope creep.

The strategy
On your reply, you want to do 4 things:

Mirror her modular framing (you’re aligned with how she wants to work).

Define your lane in a way that feels helpful, not defensive.

Ask a small set of high-leverage questions that will instantly reveal scope, dependencies, and timeline risk.

Propose a clean next step: a call agenda + an immediate “Phase 1 blueprint” deliverable you can produce quickly after the call (paid or as part of kickoff).

You don’t need to solve everything by email. Your goal is to set the tone: “I’m calm, I’m organized, I’ll make this real, and I won’t let it become chaos.”

Re: C+B + Lillier — roles, Phase 1 scope, and next steps
Thanks for the note — that modular approach makes a lot of sense, and I’m aligned with the “solid and elegant, not overengineered” goal.

I’d be happy to do a low-pressure call. If it helps, here’s what I’d suggest we cover so we can leave the conversation with clarity and a realistic Phase 1 plan:

What “Phase 1” includes for each site (C+B on Squarespace and Lillier on Shopify) — must-haves vs. explicitly later

What’s already locked vs. still in motion (design system, core IA/page list, content, photography, brand assets)

My role + handoff model — I can own the build + structure + implementation, with a setup that stays easy for your team to edit post-launch

Dependencies + pacing — what I need from your design partners, and when, to hit the March target without crunch

Ongoing partner mode after launch — what support looks like (monthly maintenance, iterative improvements, new pages/features, etc.)

A couple quick questions before we schedule so I can come prepared:

Do you already know which Squarespace plan you’re leaning toward for memberships/subscriptions, and which Shopify plan for Lillier?

Are you envisioning Phase 1 for Lillier as a standard Shopify store launch, or any multi-vendor/marketplace behavior immediately?

Will your design partner deliver a component/system spec (type scale, spacing, buttons, nav, card/grid styles, etc.), or should I propose one and have them refine?

If you share a few windows that work, I can match one. I’ll bring a lightweight proposed architecture + checklist so we can confirm responsibilities and leave with a crisp build plan.

Why this works
It validates her tone without getting gushy.

It introduces a call agenda (you lead the process).

It asks only the questions that affect feasibility and implementation.

It gently surfaces the biggest hidden scope risk: marketplace behavior.

What to do on the call (your “calm operator” script)
Use this structure; it keeps you from getting dragged into vague vision talk.

1) Start: clarify roles in plain language (2 minutes)
“Here’s what I can own end-to-end: platform setup, theme build, component implementation, responsiveness, performance basics, SEO/analytics setup, and an editing workflow your team can run with.”

Then ask:

“What are you expecting your design partner to deliver to me, and when?”

2) Force a Phase 1 definition (10–15 minutes)
For each site, ask:

“What are the must-have pages for launch?”

“What is the must-have functionality for launch?”

“What specifically is Phase 2?”

If she struggles, propose a default:

C+B Phase 1: home + about + classes/resources + subscribe/membership gating + one template page type for new content + email capture + analytics.

Lillier Phase 1: core catalog structure + collection pages + product pages + cart/checkout + search + basic merchandising + analytics.

3) Confirm content readiness (5 minutes)
“What content is locked today?”

“What content is missing and who is producing it?”

“What is the minimum viable photography for launch?”

4) Confirm technical constraints (5 minutes)
“Do you need external hosting for shared CSS/JS or should we keep everything inside platform tools?”

“Any required integrations (email, SMS, payment, shipping, subscriptions tool, CRM)?”

5) Close with a concrete deliverable (2 minutes)
End with:
“After this call, I’ll write a Phase 1 build blueprint: site map, templates, component list, required integrations, and a dependency timeline. That becomes our shared source of truth.”

That blueprint is how you protect yourself.

One line you should use if she hints at the mega marketplace idea
If she brings up the “pull in inventory from other shops” idea again, keep it crisp:

“We can absolutely design Lillier to feel like a marketplace at the UI layer, but true multi-vendor checkout requires vendor participation and operational agreements. For Phase 1, I’d recommend we launch with a curated catalog and a vendor onboarding path, then expand the marketplace behavior once the system is proven.”

No debate, no deep dive—just contain it.

If you want, paste your preferred availability windows and whether you’d rather sound more warm or more businesslike, and I’ll adjust the email to match your exact vibe.

Client's response to my sending the above:

Thank you for this. Your questions are thoughtful and very much aligned with how I’m approaching the build.
A low-pressure call sounds great. Monday at 3pm works for me if that still works for you. If not, Tuesday at 1pm or later is also fine.
Here’s a concise snapshot ahead of the call.
Phase 1 scope
Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace):
Clean, content-forward site with light membership functionality. Core pages, gated content and a solid foundation that can expand later. No heavy custom logic in Phase 1.
Lillier (Shopify):
Standard Shopify store launch with a single checkout and unified customer experience. No multi-vendor marketplace behavior at launch.
What’s locked vs in motion
Locked: vision, platform split, core page lists, tone of voice, packaging system direction.
In motion: visual system details, photography and final content polish. These are actively being produced now.
Design system
I’m working with design partners on visual direction and expect a component and system spec. If there are gaps, I’d want you to fill them pragmatically so the build stays consistent and easy to edit post-launch.
Potential roles
Owning build, structure and implementation with smart decisions that keep things flexible.
Light ongoing partner mode post-launch for maintenance and iterative improvements.
Quick answers
I’ll be using the existing Cupcakes + Broccoli Squarespace site and URL. The Shopify plan for Lillier is still being finalized, and I’m open to your recommendation there.
Let’s use the call to pressure-test scope, pacing and a realistic path to March without crunch.
Looking forward to talking

Re: C+B + Lillier — Monday at 3pm
Thanks for sending this snapshot. That all sounds very clear and very workable.

Monday at 3:00pm ET works for me. If you have a preferred video link (Zoom / Meet) feel free to send it over, and I’ll join there.

For the call, I propose we keep it simple and leave with a concrete Phase 1 plan:

Confirm Phase 1 deliverables for each site and what is explicitly out of scope until Phase 2

Review the page list and the minimum viable content needed to launch cleanly

Identify dependencies (design system spec timing, photography, copy) and set a pacing plan to March without crunch

Map the build approach for each platform so it stays consistent and easy for your team to edit post-launch

Outline “light partner mode” after launch (what’s included, cadence, and how requests get handled)

A couple small items that would help me prep:

If you can share the current C+B Squarespace URL (and any existing sitemap/page list you consider “core”)

Any early design system notes or WIP component list from your design partners, even if incomplete

For C+B membership in Phase 1, a quick note on what content needs to be gated (which pages/sections) and whether it’s one tier or multiple tiers

On Shopify plan, for a standard store launch Basic is usually sufficient, and it’s easy to upgrade later if you want more staff accounts, reporting depth, or operational features. We can pressure-test what you’ll actually need during the call and choose accordingly.

Looking forward to talking Monday.

You said:
I meant more how can I best prepare for the call.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the best way to prep so you walk into the call calm, in control, and able to “pin down” Phase 1 without sounding rigid.

1) Do 30–45 minutes of homework before the call
A) Audit the existing C+B Squarespace site (fast, focused)
Open the live site and jot down:

Current page list + what feels “core” vs “nice to have”

Any obvious template patterns already in use (blog, resources, long-form pages)

How membership is currently handled (if at all): is there any paywall, member area, newsletter capture?

Anything that’s clearly outdated or broken (so you can suggest quick wins)

Bring a simple screenshot list or notes. You want to be able to say:
“I reviewed the current site and I see 3–4 page types we can standardize in Phase 1.”

B) Define your “Phase 1 page-type system”
Even if content is in motion, you can lock the structure. Pre-write a proposal with 4–6 page types:

For C+B (Squarespace):

Core marketing page (hero + narrative sections + CTA)

Content page (article/essay format)

Gated resource page (same as content page but behind membership)

Index page (list of resources/classes, filter/search optional)

Subscribe/join page (pricing + “what you get” + CTA)
(Optional) “Dinner” landing page (invite-only info + interest form)

For Lillier (Shopify):

Homepage

Collection page (grid + filters)

Product page

Content page (About, policies)
(Optional) Editorial/blog page if needed later

This is your anchor. It keeps scope tight.

C) Prepare 2 Shopify plan recommendations (simple decision tree)
Since she said plan is open:

Basic if: low staff count, early stage, standard reporting is fine.

Shopify (mid-tier) if: more staff accounts, better reporting, gift cards, more operational tooling.

Have a one-liner: “Start Basic; upgrade if you need X/Y.”

D) Prep a “dependency checklist”
Make a list of what you need from her vs from design partners:

Logos (final), typography choice, color tokens, spacing rules

Component spec (header/footer/buttons/cards/forms)

Photography status + how it’s delivered

Copy status + who writes final

Membership tiers/pricing + gating list

Your goal is to avoid building in a vacuum.

2) Bring a one-page call agenda (and lead with it)
At the start, say:
“I want to respect your time. I’d love to use this call to confirm Phase 1 scope, identify dependencies, and leave with a clear build plan and timeline.”

Then run this order:

(1) Phase 1 definition (10 min)
“What must be live for Phase 1 to feel real?”

“What is explicitly Phase 2?”

You are listening for “light membership” details:

Single tier vs multiple tiers

What’s gated (pages? sections? downloads?)

Do they need member profiles? emails? login-only access?

(2) Page types + IA confirmation (10 min)
“Here are the page types I think we can standardize. Does this match your core page list?”

Confirm nav labels and hierarchy.

(3) Design system + content readiness (10 min)
“When will the component spec be ready, even as a v1?”

“What content must be ready by what date to avoid crunch?”

(4) Build approach + editability (10 min)
For Squarespace: how you’ll keep it client-editable (native blocks + styled templates)

For Shopify: sections-based theme customization

(5) Timeline and milestones (10 min)
Propose milestones:

IA + page types locked

Design tokens/components v1

Build in staging

Content load

QA + launch

End with next steps.

3) The key “pin-down” questions you should ask live
These are the highest leverage ones, given her latest message.

Project-wide
“What does ‘solid foundation’ mean in concrete terms: what must be easy for you to add or change post-launch?”

“Who is your internal editor day-to-day after launch?”

C+B membership (this is the biggest ambiguity)
“When you say ‘light membership’, do you mean:

a simple paywall for certain pages, or

tiers with different access, or

a full member dashboard experience?”

“Which exact pages/resources must be gated in Phase 1?”

“Do you need gated downloads (PDFs) and do you care about sharing control?”

Lillier store readiness
“How many products at launch, roughly?”

“How do you expect to organize categories and filters on mobile?”

“Any must-have apps at launch (reviews, email capture, subscription products, etc.), or keep it lean?”

Design system handoff
“Will the design partner deliver actual component specs (states, spacing, type scale), or just visual direction? If it’s direction-only, I’ll propose a pragmatic system and keep it consistent.”

Success + pacing
“What’s the ‘good enough’ bar for March 1?”

“What’s the first iteration you want immediately after launch?”

4) Have a clean proposal ready if she asks “what would you do?”
Here’s a simple, credible proposal you can say out loud:

C+B Phase 1 (Squarespace)
Use existing site as base, rebuild key templates

Set up 4–5 page types

Implement membership gating using Squarespace Member Areas (simplest) OR a lightweight integration if fees are a concern

Make everything editable through native blocks, with your CSS system doing the polish

Deliver a short “how to add a page / gate a page / update resources” guide

Lillier Phase 1 (Shopify)
Dawn-based custom theme, section-driven

Clean mobile-first IA with minimal clutter

Build collection + product templates + a flexible homepage

Keep apps minimal at launch

5) Don’t let “existing Squarespace site” become a trap
Be ready to ask:

“Are we refactoring the existing site in-place, or duplicating it into a staging copy first?”
Strong recommendation: duplicate / staging first. You don’t want to break her live site while iterating.

6) Your closing line (so you leave the call with a decision)
End with:
“After this call, I’ll write up a Phase 1 blueprint: page types, build plan, dependencies, and timeline. Once you confirm, I’ll start implementation.”

If she’s ready, you can also close with:
“I can send a fixed-scope Phase 1 estimate and an optional ongoing support retainer option.”

Quick prep checklist (print this)
 Review current C+B site and list page types

 Draft Phase 1 page-type proposal (C+B + Lillier)

 Write 6–8 pin-down questions (membership, gating list, content readiness)

 Decide your Shopify plan recommendation

 Prepare milestone timeline to March 1

 Decide whether you require a staging copy for Squarespace

If you want, paste the C+B Squarespace URL (or tell me the main pages), and I’ll help you produce a one-page “Phase 1 blueprint” you can read from during the call.

You said:
How WILL I keep it client-editable? Because I do NOT WANT to be bogged down in manually adjusting visual boxes on a grid, creating by mouse on squarespace for instance. That's fine for the client, but for me - nah.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 2s
Totally fair. The trick with Squarespace is: you don’t “design” pages by hand. You build a system (global styles + reusable sections + template pages) so you mostly work in code, and the client does the mouse stuff later.

Here’s the cleanest way to do that on Squarespace 7.1 without getting stuck nudging boxes.

The core approach: system-first, template-driven
1) Prefer Classic Editor sections for most content
Squarespace 7.1 lets you use the classic editor instead of Fluid Engine, and you can also add blank classic editor sections. 

This is your best defense against “manual grid fiddling.”

Rule of thumb:

Use Classic Editor sections for 80–90% of the site (content-forward pages, resources, classes, etc.).

Use Fluid Engine only where you truly need it (a single hero layout, a special collage, etc.), and only after you’ve locked your layout patterns.

2) Make the look-and-feel come from global CSS, not per-page tweaking
You set typography, spacing rhythm, buttons, cards, forms, and image treatments once via:

Site Styles (baseline)

Custom CSS / Code Injection (your real “theme layer”)

That way, the client can keep adding normal Squarespace blocks, and they’ll automatically look “on brand.”

3) Build a “Section Library” and reuse it everywhere
Squarespace supports Saved Sections (notably via Circle accounts) so you can save a section once and reuse it across pages. 

This is the closest thing Squarespace has to “components.”

Your workflow becomes:

Build 12–20 canonical sections once (hero, two-column text+image, card grid, quote band, CTA band, FAQ accordion, etc.).

Save them.

Assemble pages by inserting saved sections, not by designing from scratch each time.

4) Build “Template Pages” the client can duplicate
Create hidden pages like:

TEMPLATE – Standard Page

TEMPLATE – Resource Page

TEMPLATE – Gated Resource

TEMPLATE – Join/Subscribe
Then the client edits by duplicating and swapping content.

This gives you the “custom code mindset” even on a no-code CMS: you’re shipping a page system, not one-off pages.

How you avoid manual edits during development
Option A (best, least manual): host your CSS/JS and inject once
Put your compiled cb.css and cb.js on a CDN (Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / S3). Then in Squarespace, you paste one link in Code Injection and you’re done.

You keep iterating in your repo.

Deployment updates the assets.

Squarespace instantly reflects changes without you re-pasting CSS constantly.

This aligns with Squarespace’s supported approach of using code injection + code blocks for custom code. 

Option B: paste CSS into Custom CSS (more manual, still manageable)
If the client doesn’t want external hosting:

You paste the compiled CSS into Design → Custom CSS occasionally.

Still no per-page grid nudging, because the sections/templates carry structure.

What stays client-editable (without you handholding)
Client edits:
Text, images, ordering of sections

Adding a new resource page by duplicating a template

Adding a new page by inserting saved sections

Updating “gated content” by moving pages into the member area / gating rules (Phase 1 is “light membership” anyway)

You control (in code):
Typography scale, spacing system, buttons, cards, nav behavior

Mobile rules, breakpoints, “editorial rhythm”

Any JS behaviors (accordion, sticky header, subtle interactions)

The biggest “gotcha”: Code Blocks are not the answer for everything
Squarespace Code Blocks are great for small, contained custom widgets. 

But don’t build the whole page in HTML inside Code Blocks, because then the client can’t easily edit it later.

Use Code Blocks for things like:

a special “AI tool embed” placeholder (Phase 1 “no heavy custom logic”)

a custom CTA component if Squarespace blocks can’t match

tiny enhancements (not full layouts)

The exact operating rules I’d use so you don’t get trapped
No per-page styling. Everything is global styles + reusable sections.

No “pixel pushing.” Classic sections + consistent spacing utilities only.

Every page must be buildable from templates. If it can’t, it’s not Phase 1.

Client edit workflow is: duplicate template → replace content → publish.

You only touch Squarespace editor to assemble sections, not to design from scratch.

Quick question that decides the workflow
Are you (or the client) a Squarespace Circle member? If yes, saved sections become a superpower (true reusable components). 

If not, you can still do it with “template pages + duplicate,” just slightly less elegant.

If you tell me whether the existing C+B site is 7.1 and whether you can use Classic Editor sections for most pages, I’ll outline a concrete “Section Library” (the exact 15–20 sections to build first) + the exact template pages to create so Phase 1 stays fast and painless.

You said:
Are you saying I can make a custom code sections / blocks /page templates, and then save them as discrete, editable chunks for the client to reuse and reskin easily?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, but with an important caveat: in Squarespace you can save and reuse sections/layouts, not true “custom-coded components” in the way you’d do in React. You can still get 90% of what you want if you treat:

Squarespace blocks/sections = editable content containers

your CSS/JS = the design system + behavior layer

a small amount of HTML in Code Blocks = special widgets only

What you can save and reuse
Saved Sections (reusable chunks you insert on any page)

These are editable after you insert them.

Best for: hero layouts, CTAs, 2-col sections, card grids, FAQs, etc.

Depending on the account/setup, this is often done via Squarespace’s “Saved Sections” feature (many accounts have it; Circle makes it easier/standard).

Template pages you duplicate

You create a page that contains a “canonical” arrangement of sections, then duplicate it whenever you need a new page of that type.

Best for: “Resource page,” “Program page,” “About page,” “Gated resource page,” etc.

Those two together are essentially “page templates,” Squarespace-style.

What you can’t do (not cleanly)
You can’t create a fully custom-coded block type that becomes a first-class Squarespace block with its own UI fields (like a real component with props).

If you put a whole section’s layout in a Code Block as raw HTML, it can look great, but it stops being truly client-editable (they’re editing HTML, not content fields).

The best practical pattern (client-editable + you don’t pixel-push)
1) Build reusable sections using native blocks
You create a section using:

headings, text blocks, buttons, images, summaries/lists, etc.

Then your global CSS makes those blocks look like your “component system.”

Example: You style all Squarespace buttons to match your button component, all summary blocks to match your card grid, etc.

Result: client edits text/images like normal, but it stays on-brand automatically.

2) Add “utility classes” that let you reskin sections quickly
Squarespace lets you add a section “ID” (and in many cases you can add classes via Code Injection patterns). Then your CSS can target:

#section-hero

#section-cta

#section-grid

So you can have variants like:

hero: left-aligned vs centered

card grid: 2-up vs 3-up

CTA: light vs dark

without editing layout each time.

3) Use Code Blocks only for special non-standard bits
If something can’t be built with native blocks (rare), you can use a Code Block and keep it small and isolated.

Examples:

an “AI tool” placeholder widget (Phase 1)

a custom signup embed if needed

a special “collection filter” UI (not common on Squarespace)

How the client “reuses and reskins easily”
Here’s what their workflow looks like:

Add a new page by duplicating a template page.

Insert a Saved Section like “Hero A” or “CTA B.”

Edit text/images in normal block editors.

Choose a section variant by picking from a small “variant menu” you provide (usually: duplicate a variant section, or switch section ID).

Meanwhile, you retain the power:

if you improve the global CSS, the entire site updates.

The Shopify side works similarly, but even better
On Shopify, you can create true reusable components:

Sections + Blocks with editable fields

Theme editor controls

Snippets for shared UI

So your “build once” mindset is more natural there. Squarespace is “design system + saved layout” rather than “true component library.”

A concrete example of a “reusable section” that stays client-editable
You build a “Card Grid” section using a Squarespace Summary Block (client adds items) and you style it:

Summary Block becomes .cnb-card-grid

Each summary item becomes a card

Images auto-crop consistently

Hover effects and spacing are global

Client edits:

add/remove cards

reorder

change titles/descriptions

You never touch the grid again.

If you tell me which Squarespace version you’re on (7.1 yes/no) and whether the site currently uses Fluid Engine heavily, I’ll propose an exact “Section Library” (like 15 sections) and how to implement each one using native blocks + CSS so the client gets a component-like experience without you living in the editor.

You said:
Ok and what's the situation in shopify with regards to this?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 43s
Shopify is much closer to what you’re hoping Squarespace can be. With Online Store 2.0, you can absolutely build custom, reusable, client-editable “components” as:

Sections (reusable modules)

Blocks (sub-components inside a section)

JSON templates (page “recipes” that assemble sections)

Section groups (reusable header/footer and other layout-controlled groups)

Merchants then edit everything in the Theme Editor without touching code. 

What “client-editable” looks like in Shopify (the good news)
1) Sections and blocks are first-class “components”
You write a sections/whatever.liquid file and define a JSON schema inside it. The schema creates the editable UI fields the client sees (text, images, selects, toggles), and you can also define blocks they can add/reorder inside the section. 

2) Sections can be added to any page via JSON templates
In OS 2.0, templates are JSON files (for product, collection, page, etc.) that list which sections appear on that template. Merchants can add/remove/reorder sections right in the Theme Editor. 

3) You can make “global reusable chunks” with section groups
Section groups are JSON data files that store a list of sections and app blocks to render, and their settings. They’re used to make parts like header/footer customizable without code edits. 

4) You can make it scalable with dynamic sources (metafields/metaobjects)
Clients can fill structured fields (metafields/metaobjects) and connect them to section settings using dynamic sources, so “adding a new page/product type” doesn’t require layout rebuilds. 

The dev workflow that keeps you out of mouse-land
You build a section library once, then “compose” templates.

Theme file anatomy (simplified)
sections/ = your reusable components (hero, grid, editorial block, etc.)

snippets/ = tiny partials you reuse inside sections (button, icon, card)

templates/*.json = which sections appear on each page type

assets/ = CSS/JS (your design system output)

Shopify even documents that merchants can customize via settings at the theme/section/block level through JSON. 

Concrete example: a reusable “Hero” section that the client can reskin
Create sections/hero.liquid:

<section class="c-hero c-hero--{{ section.settings.variant }}">
  <div class="c-hero__inner">
    {% if section.settings.kicker != blank %}
      <p class="c-hero__kicker">{{ section.settings.kicker }}</p>
    {% endif %}

    <h1 class="c-hero__title">{{ section.settings.title }}</h1>

    {% if section.settings.body != blank %}
      <div class="c-hero__body">{{ section.settings.body }}</div>
    {% endif %}

    {% if section.settings.cta_label != blank and section.settings.cta_link != blank %}
      <a class="c-btn" href="{{ section.settings.cta_link }}">{{ section.settings.cta_label }}</a>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
</section>

{% schema %}
{
  "name": "Hero",
  "settings": [
    { "type": "text", "id": "kicker", "label": "Kicker" },
    { "type": "text", "id": "title", "label": "Title", "default": "Headline" },
    { "type": "richtext", "id": "body", "label": "Body" },
    { "type": "text", "id": "cta_label", "label": "Button label" },
    { "type": "url", "id": "cta_link", "label": "Button link" },
    {
      "type": "select",
      "id": "variant",
      "label": "Style variant",
      "default": "standard",
      "options": [
        { "value": "standard", "label": "Standard" },
        { "value": "minimal", "label": "Minimal" },
        { "value": "inset", "label": "Inset" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "presets": [{ "name": "Hero" }]
}
{% endschema %}
Now the client can:

Add this section to many pages

Swap the variant from a dropdown

Edit title/body/CTA in the UI

Reorder sections visually

That’s exactly what Shopify designed sections/settings for. 

Page templates: “save a layout recipe” (Shopify-style)
Create templates/page.about.json (example):

{
  "sections": {
    "main-hero": { "type": "hero", "settings": { "variant": "minimal" } },
    "main-richtext": { "type": "rich-text", "settings": {} },
    "main-cta": { "type": "cta", "settings": {} }
  },
  "order": ["main-hero", "main-richtext", "main-cta"]
}
That’s how you give them “templates” they can reuse. OS 2.0 is explicitly built around JSON templates and dynamic sections. 

Limits and guardrails (so you don’t overbuild)
Shopify OS 2.0 pages rendered via JSON templates/section groups have practical limits (Shopify documents caps like 25 sections per template/group and up to 50 blocks per section). 

This is fine for a clean, editorial build (and it keeps clients from turning pages into junk drawers).

So, yes: Shopify can do what you wanted Squarespace to do
If your goal is:

“I want to code reusable building blocks, then let the client assemble/edit pages without me.”

Shopify OS 2.0 is basically that. Sections/blocks/settings are the whole game. 

If you tell me what theme you’re starting from (Dawn or something else), I’ll propose a tight Phase 1 “section library” for Lillier (like 10–12 sections max) and exactly which JSON templates to create so the client can launch fast and extend later without calling you for every new page.

Help me be best-informed regarding the final portions of her recent email, as I prepare for this first zoom call with her: 
Potential roles Owning build, structure and implementation with smart decisions that keep things flexible. Light ongoing partner mode post-launch for maintenance and iterative improvements. Quick answers I’ll be using the existing Cupcakes + Broccoli Squarespace site and URL. The Shopify plan for Lillier is still being finalized, and I’m open to your recommendation there. Let’s use the call to pressure-test scope, pacing and a realistic path to March without crunch.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 32s
What she means by “content-forward” for C+B
In practice, “content-forward” almost always means:

Reading and viewing come first. The site is designed around stories, guidance, resources, and classes rather than flashy interactions or heavy UI.

Typography and spacing do the heavy lifting. Strong type scale, comfortable line length, generous whitespace, clear hierarchy.

Photography is treated like editorial. Fewer images, higher impact, consistent crop/treatment, lots of breathing room.

Minimal “UI chrome.” Fewer badges, widgets, carousels, popups, and gimmicks. Navigation is simple and calm.

Pages are easy to extend. New resource pages look great just by using the standard block patterns, without bespoke layout work each time.

“Light membership” fits the vibe. Gated content exists, but the site should not feel like a SaaS app with dashboards.

What to expect from this as the developer: you’ll be judged more on rhythm, clarity, and restraint than on fancy features.

What to expect from a “design system / component and system spec”
A good spec from her design partners will usually include most of the following. You should ask for it in a form you can actually build from.

1) Design tokens (the “system backbone”)
You want a concrete set of decisions, not vibes:

Typefaces, sizes, weights, line-heights

Spacing scale (ex: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48)

Colors (backgrounds, text, borders, accents) + states (hover/focus/disabled)

Radius, shadows, borders

Breakpoints and container widths

Your contribution if missing: create a token file yourself (even a simple JSON) and run it through both platforms as CSS variables. If partners give “visual direction” but not numbers, you turn it into numbers.

2) Component library (what you can build as Shopify Sections and Squarespace patterns)
Expect a list like:

Header/nav (desktop + mobile), footer

Buttons and links (primary/secondary/quiet)

Card patterns (resource cards, product cards)

Content modules (hero, intro block, 2-col text+image, quote, CTA band, FAQ)

Forms (newsletter, contact, waitlist)

Lists/grids

Your contribution if missing: define “defaults” and variants that match reality on Shopify and Squarespace. For example, 2 hero variants, 2 CTA variants, 2 card grid variants. Keep it tight.

3) Layout rules and content rules (the part that prevents chaos later)
This is what keeps it client-editable:

How wide text should run (max line length)

How many cards per row at each breakpoint

Image aspect ratio rules

Section padding rules

“Do not do” rules (no 5 fonts, no 10-button sections, etc.)

Your contribution if missing: write a short “layout rules” doc and treat it like part of the deliverable. This saves you from future “why does this page feel off” conversations.

4) States, accessibility, and interaction notes
At least:

Hover, focus, active states

Basic accessibility (contrast, focus rings, keyboard nav)

Motion guidelines (if any)

Your contribution if missing: implement sensible defaults and show one example page. Ask for approval once, then replicate.

How to “mesh it all together” without getting stuck between designers and platforms
This is the best mental model:

Design partners deliver the system in design language.

You translate it into platform-native building blocks.

Shopify: Sections + Blocks + JSON templates + global CSS

Squarespace: global CSS + a section library built from native blocks + a few template pages to duplicate

Your job is not to perfectly mirror Figma pixel-for-pixel. Your job is to create a repeatable system that stays consistent when the client edits.

The most important thing to clarify on the call:

Will the partners deliver a real component spec (with variants, spacing, responsive behavior), or mostly visual direction and a few page comps?

If it’s the second, you should explicitly position yourself as the one who will “productionize” it into a buildable system.

How to be best-informed for the parts of her email you quoted
1) “Owning build, structure and implementation… keep things flexible”
Translate that into what you should confirm:

What are the Phase 1 page types for C+B and Lillier?

What is the client edit workflow after launch? (duplicate template page, swap content, publish)

What is the minimum component library needed to support that workflow?

Your prep: bring a proposed list of page types and sections you’ll standardize.

2) “Light ongoing partner mode post-launch”
This can mean wildly different things. On the call, pin it down to one of these models:

Retainer: X hours/month, includes small updates, bug fixes, content help, minor section tweaks.

Ad hoc: hourly blocks as needed.

Iteration sprints: scheduled monthly or quarterly improvements.

Your prep: decide what you’re comfortable offering and what you will not do (for example, “I can support, but I’m not your full-time content uploader”).

3) “Using existing C+B Squarespace site and URL”
This has a big implementation implication:

You should strongly recommend a staging copy / duplicate workflow so you are not rebuilding directly on the live site.

Confirm Squarespace version (7.1) and whether you can lean on classic sections for most content.

Your prep: be ready to say, “I’d like to duplicate the site and rebuild on staging, then swap over when ready.”

4) “Shopify plan still being finalized, open to your recommendation”
This is your chance to sound experienced and calm.

Your default recommendation for Phase 1:

Start on Basic if it’s a standard store launch with a small team and no unusual reporting needs.

Upgrade later if they need more staff accounts, deeper reporting, operational features, or higher scale.

Your prep: ask how many staff need access and whether they care about reporting depth in Phase 1.

5) “Pressure-test scope, pacing, realistic path to March without crunch”
She is basically asking you to be the project reality-check.

Bring to the call:

A simple milestone timeline with hard dependencies:

Date design system v1 is needed

Date content must be ready (even “good enough” copy)

Date you begin build

Date content load starts

QA window

A very clear definition of what gets cut if timing slips.

Your prep: have a “scope governor” ready:

“If design system is late, we build with a pragmatic v1 token set, then refine after launch.”

“If content is late, we launch with fewer pages and solid templates.”

Your best call prep, in one checklist
Bring these written down:

Your Phase 1 page types for each site (5 max each)

Your Phase 1 section library (10–15 reusable sections)

Your dependency list (what you need and by when)

Your proposed timeline to March with a QA buffer

Your post-launch support model options (retainer vs ad hoc)

Your stance on C+B build workflow: “staging copy first”

If you want, paste the C+B URL (even privately here), and I’ll help you draft a one-page “Phase 1 build blueprint” you can literally read from during the Zoom call.

Show me visual examples which demonstrate the differences here: “Light membership” fits the vibe. Gated content exists, but the site should not feel like a SaaS app with dashboards.
ChatGPT said:

Here’s what those images are showing, and how they map to “light membership” vs “SaaS dashboards”:

A. “Light membership” (content-forward + gated content)
Example 1 (NYT-style paywall prompt): the content is the product, and the “membership” moment is just a simple interruption: Log in / Subscribe to continue reading.
What to notice:

The page still feels like an editorial site (reading experience first).

The “account” UI is minimal: login, subscribe, manage subscription.

No “home dashboard” full of widgets.

Example 2 (membership tiers / plan choice): a straightforward “pick a plan” screen that exists only to unlock content, not to become the product experience.
What to notice:

Simple plans + benefits list.

After you subscribe, you’re just back to consuming content.

B. “SaaS dashboard” (what you don’t want C+B to feel like)
Example 3 (dashboard template): this is the classic “app” vibe: charts, progress rings, data cards, lots of “system UI.”
What to notice:

Left-nav + panels + widgets + metrics.

Feels like you’re managing a tool, not reading/watching content.

Example 4 (platform admin dashboard): same idea, even if it’s for courses/memberships. It feels like a control center.
What to notice:

Task cards, setup checklists, admin-oriented flow.

The interface is the experience (not the content).

What this means for C+B in practice
“Light membership” usually looks like:

A normal site with a few gated pages/collections (member-only articles, resources, videos)

A simple login and maybe a “Member Library” page (basically a content index)

Minimal account surface area (no progress tracking, no dashboards, no stats)

If you want, I can sketch two quick wireframes (one “content-forward gated library,” one “dashboard-y portal”) so you can literally show the client: “this is what we mean by not-SaaS.”

You said:
Is 7.1 or fluid engine better for our squarespace needs?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 2m 17s
They’re not really alternatives.

Squarespace 7.1 = the site version / platform.

Fluid Engine = one of the editing experiences for sections inside 7.1 (grid-based drag/resize/overlap). In 7.1, a “block section” can be Fluid Engine or Classic Editor. 

So the real decisions for C+B are:

Is the existing C+B site on 7.0 or 7.1?

If it’s 7.1: which sections should be Fluid Engine vs Classic Editor?

My recommendation for your needs (content-forward + client-editable + you hate grid fiddling)
If C+B is already on Squarespace 7.1
Go hybrid:

Use Classic Editor sections for most of the site (editorial/content pages, resource/library pages, most CTAs). You can still add new blank Classic Editor sections in 7.1. 

Use Fluid Engine sparingly only where you truly need layout “art direction” (a hero, a special collage, maybe 1–2 signature sections).

Why:

Fluid Engine is a grid system and tends to pull you into layout-by-mouse. 

Classic Editor sections keep you in a more structured, “content-first” flow, and they’re harder for clients to accidentally wreck later.

If you upgrade a Classic section to Fluid Engine and save, you can’t revert that section back. Squarespace explicitly notes it’s not reversible after saving. 

Also: if you do convert sections to Fluid Engine, Squarespace warns the layout can shift / misalign because the two systems aren’t equivalent. 

If C+B is currently on Squarespace 7.0
For a March 1 Phase 1, I’d usually avoid upgrading to 7.1 right now unless there’s a clear blocker, because:

The 7.0 → 7.1 update can remove/alter template-specific features (headers, banners, nav behaviors, etc.), and Squarespace documents a bunch of differences. 

The update is optional but irreversible once published. 

Squarespace even recommends duplicating the 7.0 site before updating so you can reference it. 

Good news: “member sites / gated content” is supported across both versions (Squarespace documentation includes 7.0-specific notes and setup steps), so membership alone usually isn’t a reason to rush an upgrade. 

What this means in plain terms for your workflow
7.1 is the long-term direction, but Fluid Engine should not become your default if you want to avoid hand-layout work.

Your best practical setup is:

Classic sections for the content system

Fluid Engine only for a couple “signature” sections

Global CSS doing the heavy lifting so the client can edit content without “designing.”

One quick check you can do before the call
Ask (or check yourself in the editor):

When editing a section, if you see “Add Block” in the top-right, it’s Fluid Engine; if you see insert “+” points between blocks, it’s Classic Editor. Squarespace describes this distinction. 

If you tell me whether C+B is 7.0 or 7.1, I’ll give you a concrete “Phase 1 policy” like:

“Only 2 Fluid Engine sections allowed site-wide”

“Everything else built from Classic sections + reusable patterns”
so you don’t get dragged into layout drudgery.

You said:

Your best call prep, in one checklist

Bring these written down:

Your Phase 1 page types for each site (5 max each)

Your Phase 1 section library (10–15 reusable sections)

Your proposed timeline to March with a QA buffer

Your post-launch support model options (retainer vs ad hoc)
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 27s
Here you go — written as “notes you can literally have open during the Zoom.”

1) Phase 1 page types (5 max each)
Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace)
Home (editorial landing + key pathways: resources, classes, join)

Standard Content Page (about/manifesto/long-form; this is your main “writing” template)

Index / Library Page (resources list, classes list, or both; built from a consistent grid/list pattern)

Detail Page (resource/class detail; same structure whether public or gated)

Join / Membership Page (pricing/tiers + what’s included + login entry point)

Note: “Gated vs public” should be a setting/workflow (page access) not a separate template you design twice.

Lillier (Shopify)
Homepage (editorial merch + featured collections)

Collection Page (PLP) (grid + filters/sort + mobile-first)

Product Page (PDP) (gallery, description, variants, add to cart, trust info)

Content Page (about, contact, policies, brand story templates)

Search Results Page (search + filters/merch rules)

2) Phase 1 section library (10–15 reusable sections)
These are your “components.” Build once (as Shopify sections) and mirror as closely as possible in Squarespace using native blocks + global CSS patterns.

Header / Navigation (mobile menu pattern locked)

Footer (newsletter + utility links + cross-brand subtle link)

Hero A: Editorial (kicker, headline, subcopy, CTA, optional image)

Hero B: Split (text left, image right, CTA)

Narrative / Longform Block (rich text with strong typography rhythm)

Card Grid (3-up desktop / 2-up tablet / 1-up mobile)

Featured Item(s) (one “spotlight card” or featured product/resource)

Image + Text Band (alternating left/right)

Quote / Pull-quote Band (editorial styling)

FAQ / Accordion (for membership, shipping, policies)

CTA Band (minimal, high-contrast variant + neutral variant)

Email Capture / Form (newsletter / waitlist / interest form)

“Membership Gate” Callout (lightweight “log in / join to access”)

Logo/Press/Partner Strip (optional, low visual noise)

Announcement / Notice Bar (rare, but useful for launch)

If you need to cut to stay lean: drop #14 and #15.

3) Dependency list (what you need, and by when)
Assuming today is Jan 5 and launch target is Mar 1, you need inputs fast. Use these as “asks” on the call.

Access + admin (needed this week)
Squarespace admin access to existing C+B site (and permission to duplicate for staging)

Shopify collaborator access (or dev store access if not created yet)

Domain/DNS access only if launch involves changes (otherwise later)

Structure + content decisions (needed by end of Week 1 / early Week 2)
Final Phase 1 page list for each site (titles + brief purpose)

Membership scope for C+B: tiers/pricing (or “single tier”), what’s gated, and what’s public

Any “must-have” integrations for Phase 1 (email platform, forms destination, etc.)

Design system handoff (needed by mid Week 2)
From design partners (even if incomplete):

Type scale + font choices

Color tokens + usage rules

Spacing rules + container widths

Component spec for: header, footer, buttons, cards, forms, grid behavior

1–2 key page comps (home + one interior page) is enough if the system is strong

From you (if gaps exist):

A pragmatic “production spec”: defaults + states + mobile rules you’ll implement consistently

Asset readiness (staggered, but don’t let it slip past Week 4)
Photography delivery plan (what’s ready for Phase 1 vs placeholder)

Copy readiness plan (who writes final, and deadlines)

Logos, brand marks, any packaging visuals that must appear

Shopify commerce inputs (needed by Week 3)
Product catalog size + collection taxonomy (even rough)

Shipping/returns policy text (draft is fine)

Any Phase 1 apps they know they want (or a commitment to keep it lean)

4) Proposed timeline to March 1 (with QA buffer)
A realistic path that avoids crunch is “system first, build fast, content load last, QA protected.”

Week 1 (Jan 5–Jan 11): Scope lock + staging setup
Confirm Phase 1 page list + membership scope

Duplicate C+B site to staging

Create Shopify store/theme dev setup

Confirm “what’s locked vs in motion” in a single tracker

Week 2 (Jan 12–Jan 18): Design system v1 → tokens + base styles
Receive design system spec v1

You translate into tokens + base CSS rules

Build header/footer + typography rhythm first

Create templates for page types (Squarespace + Shopify)

Week 3 (Jan 19–Jan 25): Section library build (core)
Build ~8–10 core sections

Establish mobile behavior + spacing rules

First internal review: one “golden path” page per site

Week 4 (Jan 26–Feb 1): Finish section library + key templates
Complete remaining sections

Lillier: collection + product template pass (lean, fast, clean)

C+B: membership gating configured (lightweight)

Week 5 (Feb 2–Feb 8): Content load sprint 1 + polish
Populate core pages with real content where available

Replace placeholders with real photography as it arrives

Fix layout edge cases

Week 6 (Feb 9–Feb 15): Content load sprint 2 + soft QA
Finish remaining core content

Accessibility pass (focus, contrast, headings)

Mobile QA across major breakpoints/devices

Week 7 (Feb 16–Feb 22): Full QA + performance + launch checklist
Link QA, form QA, membership QA, checkout QA

Final tweaks from design partner feedback

Prepare launch steps + rollback plan

Week 8 (Feb 23–Mar 1): Launch window + buffer
Launch early in the week if possible

Keep the last days as pure buffer + hotfix window

Important boundary to say on the call:
If design system assets/content slip past Week 4, you either (a) launch with fewer pages, or (b) launch with placeholders, but you do not compress QA.

5) Post-launch support model options (retainer vs ad hoc)
Give her three clean choices so she can pick a vibe.

Option A: Light monthly retainer (recommended)
Fixed hours/month (ex: 4–8 hrs)

Includes: small updates, content help, minor layout tweaks, bug fixes

Anything large becomes a scoped mini-project

Option B: Ad hoc support
Hourly, billed in blocks (ex: minimum 2-hour blocks)

Good if requests are infrequent

Risk: slower turnaround if you’re booked

Option C: Iteration sprints
One planned sprint per month (or per quarter)

You maintain a backlog, then ship improvements in batches

Best if she wants ongoing evolution without constant pings

What you should explicitly exclude unless paid as a project: major new features, marketplace behavior, heavy custom “AI tool” logic, large-scale content migration, complex integrations.

If you want, I can also turn this into a 1-page “call sheet” you can paste into a doc (with a tight call agenda + the exact questions to ask in each segment).

Thought for 25s
Great set of notes. Here’s how I’d turn that 15-minute call into momentum, clarity, and a clean “yes” path without accidentally inheriting vague scope.

1) Clean recap you can keep as your internal truth
What’s decided

Two sites, two platforms: C+B stays on Squarespace, Lillier launches on Shopify.

Phase-based approach, with March 1 a target (not a hard deadline).

Design + copy + core page lists are defined/being locked; you’re not being asked to “design,” you’re being asked to execute.

C+B business model: subscription.

Lillier business model: commission-based (needs a concrete operational definition).

AI tool is later phase; Phase 1 = no heavy custom logic.

Visual system details + photography are still in motion; photography needs differ per brand (Lillier needs product shots).

What she wants from you

Own build, structure, and execution across both platforms.

Make pragmatic choices that keep the sites easy for her to extend.

Potentially serve as ongoing site partner (updates + light management), not just a one-off build.

What you should treat as “open until confirmed”

What “commission-based” means operationally on Shopify in Phase 1 (since marketplace behavior is not at launch).

The exact Phase 1 deliverables and what is explicitly Phase 2.

2) The two most important clarifications to nail early
These are the ones that can silently explode scope later.

A) “Commission-based” on Lillier (what exactly does that mean in Phase 1?)
Ask her to choose one (even if it’s provisional):

Wholesale / margin model (Lillier buys inventory or sets retail price above cost; commission is effectively margin).

Affiliate / referral (link-out checkout on vendor sites; commission via affiliate tracking).

Consignment / vendor payout (single checkout on Lillier, then payouts to vendors later; usually needs marketplace ops).

Drop-ship (single checkout but vendor fulfills; still operationally marketplace-like, even if “Phase 1 standard store”).

If she says “standard Shopify store launch, no marketplace,” the cleanest is usually (1) for Phase 1.

B) Ongoing partner mode (what are you actually responsible for?)
She said she’s the “fire putter-outer.” That can be good, but you still need boundaries:

Are you expected to do content updates weekly?

Are you expected to manage Shopify products/collections?

Are you expected to manage membership content gates?

What counts as “maintenance” vs “new feature”?

You want to define this now so you don’t become an on-call dev/content manager by accident.

3) What to send her next (fast, confident, low-friction)
You want to reply with:

A quick recap (shows you listened)

A “yes, I’m in”

3–5 clarifying questions (only the high-leverage ones)

A proposed structure for engagement (hourly + cap, or retainer options)

Immediate next steps (access + assets + dates)

Suggested email you can send
Email
Subject
Next steps after our call
Thanks again for the call — I’m aligned with the phased approach and the “solid but elegant” goal.

My understanding from our conversation:

C+B stays on Squarespace (subscription-based, content-forward, light membership in Phase 1; AI tool later phase).

Lillier launches on Shopify (Phase 1 is a standard store experience with a unified checkout; marketplace behavior later if/when needed).

Design partners will deliver the visual system and component spec, and you’d like me to fill any pragmatic gaps so the build stays consistent and easy to extend.

I’m excited to move forward. To keep Phase 1 crisp and avoid surprises, I have a few quick clarifiers:

For Lillier, when you say “commission-based,” what is the Phase 1 operational model (wholesale/margin vs affiliate link-out vs consignment/payout later vs drop-ship)?

For C+B Phase 1 membership, is it one tier or multiple tiers, and which exact pages/resources are gated at launch?

Do you want me to work on a staging/duplicate of the existing C+B Squarespace site first, then swap over at launch?

What’s the target timing for the design system handoff (tokens + component spec v1), and who should I coordinate with directly for build questions?

On compensation, I’m happy to structure this either:

Hourly for the build phase (with an agreed weekly cap), then a light monthly retainer post-launch, or

A fixed Phase 1 build scope with milestone payments, plus an optional monthly retainer afterward.

If you send the current core page lists for both sites and grant collaborator access (Squarespace + Shopify), I can put together a Phase 1 execution plan with milestones and an estimated timeline to March, including a QA buffer.

(You’ll want to insert your rate / caps once you decide—see below.)

4) Your retainer / hourly options (pick one and lead with it)
Since she explicitly asked “hourly or monthly pay/retainer,” give her 2–3 choices. Keep it simple.

Option A: Hourly + weekly cap (best during build)
Rate: $___ / hour

Cap: ___ hours/week (prevents “surprise” workload)

Billing: weekly or biweekly

Scope: Phase 1 build + implementation, plus small coordination with design partners

Why it’s good: protects you and keeps it flexible while design and content are still moving.

Option B: Fixed Phase 1 build (best if scope is already stable)
Milestone 1: setup + templates + core sections

Milestone 2: membership gating + Shopify theme pages

Milestone 3: content load support + QA + launch

Each milestone has a fixed $.

Why it’s good: if she truly has page lists locked and design is coming fast, this feels “premium and intentional.”

Option C: Post-launch “light partner mode” retainer (offer after launch either way)
Give 3 tiers so she can choose:

Lite (2–4 hrs/mo): small updates, minor fixes, quick QA checks

Standard (6–8 hrs/mo): ongoing edits, small improvements, monthly polish

Plus (10–12 hrs/mo): active site partner, frequent updates, faster turnaround

Define what’s included: “content updates + minor layout adjustments + small section tweaks”
Define what’s excluded: “new features, major integrations, AI tool build, marketplace mechanics”

5) What you should prepare for yourself before the next longer call
Make these 1-page bullets so you can speak confidently:

A) Phase 1 deliverables (super concrete)
C+B Phase 1

refreshed templates (home, about, join, library/index, resource detail)

membership gating for specific pages/resources

consistent typography + spacing system via global CSS

section library (10–12 reusable sections)

staging workflow + launch checklist

Lillier Phase 1

Dawn-based theme with your section set (home, collection, product, content)

taxonomy structure (collections + filters)

product photography requirements list (aspect ratios, minimum counts)

checkout and essential pages (shipping, returns, about)

B) The exact “design handoff” you need from her partners
Ask for a single “handoff pack”:

Tokens: fonts, sizes, spacing scale, colors, radii

Components: header/footer, buttons, cards, forms, grid rules

Page comps: home + one interior page per brand

Responsive notes: mobile nav behavior + grid breakpoints

C) Your “don’t let this happen” boundaries
No AI tool in Phase 1

No multi-vendor marketplace mechanics in Phase 1

No endless content uploading without a support plan (retainer or weekly cap)

If you tell me your preferred billing approach (hourly+cap vs fixed milestones) and your rough rate range (even privately), I’ll tighten the email so it includes exact numbers and feels decisive, not tentative.

You said:
I like option B for my payment option first choice. She included in her brief that she has a $12,500 USD total budget for this project. She said in the call she is self-funded. I am not the only person she has to pay for this project. what are some realistic breakdowns for what I should be paid for this work? we have worked together in the past, we trust each other, and she even had me house-sit overnight her dog for several days when she was gone for work previously, for some context. I am not trying to rip her off. Thanks.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 28s
Given $12,500 total and the fact that you’re owning the build/execution of two sites (Squarespace + Shopify) while design partners + photography are also getting paid, a reasonable target is usually:

You (dev/build lead): ~40%–60% of total budget
(because you’re implementing two platforms + making it editable + QA + launch)

Design system + visual direction: ~20%–35%

Photography/content production: ~10%–30%

Apps/tools/contingency: ~5%–15%

So your “fair, not-ripping-anyone-off” band is roughly:

A realistic pay range for you
$5,000–$7,500 for Phase 1 build (both sites)

Optional post-launch retainer on top (separate), like $400–$1,200/mo depending on involvement

If you go much above ~$7.5k, you’re likely squeezing design/photo too hard inside $12.5k. If you go much below ~$5k, you’re probably underpaying yourself for two-platform execution + making it client-editable.

Three realistic breakdowns you can choose from
1) Lean / relationship-friendly (good if scope is truly tight)
You: $5,250 (42%)
Remaining for others + tools: $7,250

When this is fair:

Page lists are truly locked

Minimal custom section library

Minimal Shopify apps

You’re not doing heavy content migration or ongoing product uploads

2) Balanced / most realistic (my recommended “sweet spot”)
You: $6,500 (52%)
Remaining: $6,000

When this is fair:

You’re building a real reusable section system on both platforms

You’re doing staging + QA + launch

You’re doing enough “systems thinking” to keep it easy to extend

3) Higher-touch / you’re basically the web ops partner during build
You: $7,500 (60%)
Remaining: $5,000

Only fair if you’re also doing several of these:

Lots of content loading + cleanup on Squarespace

Shopify catalog structure setup (collections, navigation, product template setup, some product importing)

More rounds of polish / iteration with design partners

You’re expected to be very responsive and handle many small changes quickly

Option B milestone breakdowns (examples you can copy)
Balanced milestone plan: $6,500 total
Phase 1 blueprint + staging setup (Squarespace duplicate + Shopify dev setup) — $900

Design system implementation (tokens → CSS rules, typography, spacing rhythm, global components) — $1,600

C+B build (Phase 1) (templates + section library + membership gating) — $1,800

Lillier build (Phase 1) (theme setup, homepage/collection/product/content templates, nav) — $1,700

QA + launch support (mobile QA, fixes, go-live window) — $500

Total: $6,500

Lean milestone plan: $5,250 total
Blueprint + staging — $750

C+B templates + light membership — $1,650

Lillier standard theme implementation — $1,650

Global polish + QA + launch — $1,200

Total: $5,250

Higher-touch milestone plan: $7,500 total
Blueprint + staging + build plan — $1,000

Design system implementation + section library (bigger library) — $2,200

C+B build + membership + content assist — $2,100

Lillier build + collection strategy + light catalog assist — $1,700

QA + launch + post-launch hotfix window — $500

Total: $7,500

Payment schedule that feels professional (and protects you)
For fixed-scope milestone work, a common structure:

40% deposit to start

30% after first major build review (templates/sections in place)

30% at launch (or at “ready to launch” signoff)

Or milestone-by-milestone: invoice at each milestone completion.

The most important “fairness” guardrail
To keep it fair for both of you, define what’s not included in Phase 1 price:

AI tool (explicitly Phase 2)

Marketplace/multi-vendor mechanics (explicitly not Phase 1)

Unlimited content loading/product entry

Net-new features not in the Phase 1 blueprint

Then you can be generous without getting buried.

My recommendation for you, given your tone and relationship
Lead with $6,500 fixed for Phase 1 + offer an optional post-launch retainer:

Retainer Lite: $450/mo (1–2 hrs)

Standard: $900/mo (3–4 hrs)

Plus: $1,400/mo (5–6 hrs)

That aligns with “I’m not trying to rip you off” while still paying you like the person who makes two sites actually happen.

If you want, tell me your rough hourly rate you’d normally charge (even a range), and I’ll sanity-check whether $6.5k implies a realistic number of hours for what Phase 1 contains.

You said:
Let's plan on a 6k ask for phase 1 work. Then 400, 700, and 1000 usd monthly maintenance plan options for after launch. help me justify these. thanks.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clean, defensible way to justify $6,000 for Phase 1 and $400 / $700 / $1,000 monthly afterward, without sounding like you’re “selling.” The framing is: two platforms, reusable systems, clean handoff, and guardrails that prevent chaos.

1) Justifying the $6,000 Phase 1 fixed fee
The simple logic (what she’s actually buying)
You’re not charging for “pages.” You’re charging for:

Two platform builds (Squarespace + Shopify)

A shared system (typography, spacing rhythm, components/sections) applied consistently

A build that is easy for her to extend without re-hiring you for every new page

A Phase 1 blueprint + scope control, plus QA + launch support

That’s what turns “ambitious vision” into something real, on schedule.

The “time math” you can cite (without overexplaining)
A $6,000 fixed Phase 1 fee usually implies roughly 40–60 hours depending on your effective rate and how clean the inputs are (design/copy/page lists already locked helps). That’s realistic for:

system setup + section library

two platforms

QA + launch

You don’t need to state your hourly rate unless she asks, but you can say:

“This is priced as a fixed Phase 1 execution scope, roughly equivalent to ~X weeks of focused build time, with a clear blueprint and handoff.”

What makes $6,000 “fair” inside a $12,500 total budget
It leaves room for her design partners + photography while still valuing the person doing full implementation.

It matches her “modular + supported” intent: you take the build lane and don’t compete with design spend.

It’s not a bargain-basement number for two platforms, but it’s also not consuming the entire budget.

What you should attach to the $6,000 (to protect both of you)
Make the justification stronger by tying it to deliverables and boundaries:

Included in $6,000 Phase 1

Phase 1 execution plan (page types + section library + milestones)

C+B Squarespace Phase 1 build on staging, then launch swap

Lillier Shopify Phase 1 theme implementation (standard store experience, no marketplace mechanics)

Shared design system implementation (tokens → CSS rules) + pragmatic gap-filling

QA + launch support window

Explicitly not included (Phase 2 / separate scope)

AI tool build

Marketplace/multi-vendor mechanics

Large-scale content migration or “unlimited content uploading”

Net-new features beyond the Phase 1 blueprint

This makes the $6k feel like a “solid, elegant foundation,” not an open-ended promise.

2) Justifying the monthly maintenance tiers ($400 / $700 / $1,000)
Frame these as ongoing site partner options that match how she described wanting to operate: someone who can keep things tidy and evolving while she handles broader fires.

What you’re really selling here
Response time + continuity + proactive upkeep

A predictable way to handle “small but constant” tasks: edits, tweaks, app conflicts, subscription settings, theme adjustments, seasonal updates, buglets.

You’re not selling “time.” You’re selling “we won’t lose momentum after launch.”

Make each tier about outcomes (and include hours as a guideline)
You can define each plan as “up to X hours/month,” with rollover rules. Example:

$400/mo — Lite
Best for: stability + small updates

Up to 1–2 hours/month

Minor content updates (text/image swaps)

Basic troubleshooting and quick fixes

Light monitoring after platform updates (theme/app conflicts)

Email support, non-urgent turnaround

Why it’s justified: it keeps you “on call” in a small way, so little issues don’t become big ones.

$700/mo — Standard
Best for: active upkeep + small improvements

Up to 3–4 hours/month

Everything in Lite

Monthly iteration: small layout improvements, new sections added, navigation refinements

Shopify: collection merchandising tweaks, template adjustments

Squarespace: membership gating tweaks, resource organization support

Why it’s justified: this is the “real partner mode” for a live brand that’s evolving.

$1,000/mo — Plus
Best for: ongoing growth + faster cadence

Up to 5–6 hours/month

Everything in Standard

Priority turnaround

More proactive improvements: new page builds from templates, A/B-ish refinements (light), ongoing polish cycles

Coordination with other partners if needed (design/photo) to implement updates smoothly

Why it’s justified: this gives her “a dev on the team” feeling without hiring someone full-time.

The boundary that makes retainers feel safe
Say this clearly:

Retainer covers maintenance + small iterative work.

Anything “new feature / Phase 2” gets a mini-scope and separate estimate.

That keeps your relationship healthy and prevents resentment.

3) The exact language to justify it (copy/paste)
You can use something like this in a proposal or email:

Phase 1 build (fixed: $6,000): This covers end-to-end implementation of both sites (C+B on Squarespace using the existing site/URL, and Lillier on Shopify as a standard store launch), plus a shared component system applied consistently across platforms, pragmatic gap-filling from the design system spec, and a clean handoff so your team can extend pages easily post-launch. It includes staging, QA, and a launch support window.

Ongoing partner mode (optional): After launch, I can stay on as a light site partner for maintenance and iterative improvements. I’m proposing three options: $400/mo (Lite), $700/mo (Standard), $1,000/mo (Plus), scaled by expected monthly update volume and turnaround needs. Anything outside maintenance or small iterative work (Phase 2 features like the AI tool, marketplace mechanics, major integrations) would be scoped separately.

4) One practical improvement: add “rollover” to make it feel generous
This helps trust and reduces friction:

Allow up to 1 month rollover of unused hours (cap it at one month).

Or: “unused time doesn’t roll over, but you get priority scheduling.”

Rollover makes the plans feel fair when a month is quiet.

5) What you should prepare next (so the ask lands cleanly)
Draft a 1-page “Phase 1 Scope” with:

Deliverables (bullets)

Out-of-scope (bullets)

Milestones + dates

Payment schedule (40/30/30 or milestone-based)

Retainer tiers

If you paste your preferred payment schedule (deposit vs milestones) and how many hours you want each retainer tier to imply, I’ll turn this into a polished proposal you can send.

Phase 1 Scope + Support Options (Draft)
Below is a one-page draft of Phase 1 scope and optional ongoing support. Happy to refine once you share the final page lists and the design system handoff timing.

PHASE 1 SCOPE (Fixed Fee: $6,000)

Goal
Deliver two clean, cohesive Phase 1 sites on their respective platforms (C+B on Squarespace using the existing site/URL; Lillier on Shopify as a standard store launch), implemented from the approved page lists, brand voice/copy, and the design system/component spec. The build will prioritize a solid, elegant foundation that is easy for your team to extend post-launch.

Deliverables (Phase 1)
Project-wide

Phase 1 execution blueprint: confirmed page types, section/component library plan, and implementation checklist

Implementation of the shared visual system across both sites (typography, spacing rhythm, buttons/cards/forms, and consistent layout rules), based on the design partners’ component/system spec, with pragmatic gap-filling as needed

Mobile-first QA pass and launch checklist

Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace)

Work from the existing Squarespace site and URL, with a staging/duplicate build workflow to protect the live site during implementation

Phase 1 page templates/page types implemented per the core page list (content-forward, clean layout patterns)

Light membership setup for Phase 1: gated content configured per the agreed list of gated pages/resources

Reusable section patterns so new pages can be created by duplicating template pages / inserting predefined sections, without bespoke layout work each time

Final QA and launch swap/transition plan

Lillier (Shopify)

Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme implementation (standard store launch, single checkout, unified customer experience)

Core templates configured: homepage, collection pages, product pages, and core content pages per the Phase 1 page list

Navigation + collection structure setup aligned with the agreed taxonomy

Theme section blocks configured so your team can extend/edit pages and merchandising without code changes

Final QA and launch checklist support

Out of Scope (Phase 1)

AI tool build or custom AI logic (explicitly Phase 2)

Multi-vendor marketplace mechanics (vendor onboarding, split payouts, vendor order routing), and other non-standard marketplace workflows

Extensive content migration from prior platforms or “unlimited” content uploading/entry beyond the Phase 1 core pages and agreed initial catalog structure

Major custom apps/integrations beyond standard platform capabilities unless separately scoped

Ongoing photography production, copywriting, or brand strategy work (inputs provided by your team/partners)

Milestones + Target Dates (assuming kickoff immediately; can adjust)

Milestone 1 (Week 1): Kickoff + access + staging setup + Phase 1 blueprint finalized

Milestone 2 (Week 2): Design system v1 applied (tokens/base styles) + header/footer + core layout rules implemented on both platforms

Milestone 3 (Weeks 3–4): C+B Phase 1 build complete in staging (templates + gated content configured) and Lillier templates/sections implemented in Shopify

Milestone 4 (Weeks 5–6): Content load support (core pages), polish, and QA pass

Milestone 5 (Weeks 7–8): Final QA + launch window (targeting March 1, with buffer)

Payment Schedule (Fixed Phase 1 Fee: $6,000)
Option A (40/30/30)

40% ($2,400) to begin work and reserve build time

30% ($1,800) at “Build Review” (core templates/sections in place on both sites)

30% ($1,800) at launch readiness / go-live

Optional Ongoing Partner Mode (Post-Launch Support)
Lite — $400/month

Best for: stability + small updates

Up to ~1–2 hours/month of minor content updates, small fixes, and light troubleshooting

Standard — $700/month

Best for: active upkeep + small improvements

Up to ~3–4 hours/month, includes Lite coverage plus small iterative enhancements and merchandising/layout adjustments

Plus — $1,000/month

Best for: ongoing evolution + faster turnaround

Up to ~5–6 hours/month, priority responsiveness, and a higher cadence of updates and improvements

Notes

Retainer covers maintenance and small iterative work. Larger Phase 2 items (AI tool build, marketplace mechanics, major new features) would be scoped separately as mini-projects.

If you’d like, we can define a simple request workflow (monthly backlog + priorities) so updates stay organized and low-friction.

Ensure our phase 1 scope and support options draft is accurate to the best of its ability with regard to the context we have from 1) the client's brief (attached doc), and 2) her email answers (pasted below), and 3) my notes from our zoom call (attached doc).

her email answers: 
Here’s a concise snapshot ahead of the call.
Phase 1 scope
Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace):
Clean, content-forward site with light membership functionality. Core pages, gated content and a solid foundation that can expand later. No heavy custom logic in Phase 1.
Lillier (Shopify):
Standard Shopify store launch with a single checkout and unified customer experience. No multi-vendor marketplace behavior at launch.
What’s locked vs in motion
Locked: vision, platform split, core page lists, tone of voice, packaging system direction.
In motion: visual system details, photography and final content polish. These are actively being produced now.
Design system
I’m working with design partners on visual direction and expect a component and system spec. If there are gaps, I’d want you to fill them pragmatically so the build stays consistent and easy to edit post-launch.
Potential roles
Owning build, structure and implementation with smart decisions that keep things flexible.
Light ongoing partner mode post-launch for maintenance and iterative improvements.
Quick answers
I’ll be using the existing Cupcakes + Broccoli Squarespace site and URL. The Shopify plan for Lillier is still being finalized, and I’m open to your recommendation there.
Let’s use the call to pressure-test scope, pacing and a realistic path to March without crunch.


Take your time and really think step by step. Review all docs carefully and in full, front to finish before crafting your plan and eventual reply. Thank you for taking your time and being thorough in this matter!

Post-Launch Support Options (Monthly)
Tier A — $400/mo

Small updates + light troubleshooting (≈ up to 2 hrs/mo)

Tier B — $700/mo

Tier A + iterative improvements / small new sections/pages (≈ up to 4 hrs/mo)

Tier C — $1,000/mo

Tier B + higher cadence + priority turnaround + periodic UX cleanup (≈ up to 6–8 hrs/mo)

Notes: Retainers cover maintenance + small iterative work. New features / Phase 2 items are scoped separately.

If you want, I can also compress the milestone section further into a single line (or convert the whole thing into a super clean “proposal sheet” format with headers that look good in a PDF).

Thought for 13s
Phase 1 Scope (Draft)
Goal: Two mobile-first sites with shared design DNA and clear structure, built for easy client editing and extension.

Deliverables (Phase 1)
Shared (both sites)

Implement design partners’ component/system spec; fill gaps pragmatically to keep everything consistent and editable.

Core templates + navigation + responsive layouts.

CMS-driven editing workflows (client can add/edit pages without breaking design).

Baseline SEO + analytics baked in (setup/implementation assuming access to accounts).

QA + launch checklist.

Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace)

Build inside the existing Squarespace site + URL (using a safe staging/duplicate workflow).

Content-forward templates and reusable sections.

Light membership / gated content for agreed pages/resources (no dashboard/SaaS feel).

Lillier (Shopify)

Standard Shopify store launch (single checkout, unified customer experience).

Theme implementation with reusable sections and core templates.

Collections/product templates + navigation aligned to the agreed architecture.

Dependencies (Provided by partners)
Component/system spec (or working draft) from design partners.

Final content + photography (incl. product shots for Lillier; distinct founder/CEO imagery if planned).

Access: Squarespace admin, Shopify admin, domain/DNS as needed, analytics accounts.

Milestones (Targeting March 1)
M1: Kickoff + confirm Phase 1 page list + dependencies + build plan

M2: System + core templates/sections implemented on both platforms

M3: Content placement + polish

M4: QA + launch readiness + launch window

(March 1 is a target, not a hard deadline.)

Phase 1 Retainer + Payment Schedule
Phase 1 budget: $6,000

40/30/30

40% to start

30% at “templates + system implemented” milestone

30% at launch readiness / go-live

Post-Launch Support Options (Monthly)
Tier A — $400/mo

Small updates, upkeep, light troubleshooting, minor edits

Tier B — $700/mo

Tier A + iterative improvements, small new sections/pages, ongoing optimization

Tier C — $1,000/mo

Tier B + priority responsiveness, higher cadence of updates, periodic UX cleanup and housekeeping

Note: These cover maintenance and small iterative work; larger Phase 2 items are scoped separately.

You said:
I got this reply from the client. Also what's an SOW? Anything else I need to know at this point? thanks. 
Hi Stephen,
Thank you again for the thoughtful proposal. I’m aligned on the Phase 1 scope and the $6k budget and excited to move forward.
One small thing I’d like to adjust is the payment structure so it’s a bit more evenly tied to progress and launch. Instead of the 40/30/30 split, I’d prefer a 30/40/30 structure, outlined as:
30% at kickoff
40% once core pages are built and ready for review
30% at launch
Everything else in the proposal looks good to me. If this payment structure works on your end, I can send over a simple agreement and SOW so we can get started and stay on track for a March 1 launch.
Looking forward to building this together.
ChatGPT said:
Her reply is good news: she’s accepting scope + budget, and she’s proposing a very normal tweak to the payment milestones.

What’s an SOW?
SOW = Statement of Work. It’s the document that spells out:

what you’re delivering (scope/deliverables)

what’s not included

timeline/milestones

payment schedule + invoicing terms

responsibilities/dependencies (design spec, content, access)

revision limits / change-request process

launch + post-launch support terms

Think of it as the “operating manual” for the project so nobody has to rely on memory.

Is 30/40/30 reasonable?
Yes — as long as “core pages built and ready for review” is clearly defined so you’re not doing 80% of the work before the 40% payment triggers.

You’ll want to tighten that milestone to something measurable, like:

both sites have global styles applied

navigation + header/footer are in place

all agreed Phase 1 core templates are built in staging/dev

gated content mechanism is configured (C+B)

Shopify core templates are functional (home/collection/product/content)

content can be placeholder if final photography/copy isn’t ready

That way the 40% is tied to build completion, not final polish.

Anything else you should know/do right now
Before you let her send the agreement/SOW, make sure these are explicitly in it (quick list):

Definition of “core pages built” (what triggers the 40%)

Dependencies: design system handoff, photography, copy, access

Out-of-scope items explicitly excluded (AI tool, marketplace)

Revision / iteration expectations (e.g., number of review rounds per milestone)

Launch definition: what counts as “launch” (go-live on primary domain) and what happens if dependencies delay it

Post-launch support: your $400/$700/$1,000 tiers as optional add-on, and what’s included/excluded

Staging approach: you’ll work in a staging/duplicate environment (especially for Squarespace) until go-live

Payment terms: net 7/14, late fee policy (optional), and that you invoice at each milestone

A concise reply you can send her
(No em-dashes.)

Re: Phase 1 scope and payment structure
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the note. I’m aligned and excited to get started as well.

The 30/40/30 structure works for me. To keep it clean and tied to progress, I suggest we define the 40% milestone as: core Phase 1 templates/pages for both sites built in staging/dev, with global styles applied, navigation/header/footer in place, and the membership gating (C+B) and Shopify core templates functional. Content and photography can still be in progress at that point.

If that matches your intent, feel free to send over the agreement and SOW. Once I review and we sign, I can invoice the 30% kickoff and we can begin immediately.

Looking forward to building this together.
Stephen

If you paste the SOW once she sends it, I can help you redline it for missing protections or any language that could quietly expand scope.

Thought for 4 seconds
Overall: this is clean and workable for a Phase 1. It matches what you and she agreed on (scope + $6k + 30/40/30) and it’s not bloated. 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…

 
Consulting Services Agreement_S…


That said, there are a few small tweaks I’d recommend to protect you from scope creep and “launch hostage” situations, without making it adversarial.

What looks good
Scope is clear and aligned: shared system, Squarespace existing site/URL, light gating, Shopify single store, no marketplace. 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


Out-of-scope is appropriately firm (custom apps, advanced membership, copy/photo, Phase 2). 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


Milestone payment wording is close to what you want and includes the “presented for review” checkpoint. 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


Invoices due in 7 days is great for cashflow. 
Consulting Services Agreement_S…


IP transfer upon full payment is standard, and portfolio permission is included. 
Consulting Services Agreement_S…


The main risks and the smallest fixes
1) Define what “launch (site live)” means, and what happens if dependencies delay it
Right now the final 30% is tied to “at launch (site live)”. 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


That’s fine if “live” is under your control. But you already have dependency risk (copy/photo/design system access), and the SOW acknowledges delays may impact timeline. 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


Fix: change the final milestone to something like:

“30% at launch readiness (sites approved for go-live) or go-live, whichever occurs first,” or

“30% when sites are delivered to production environment / ready to publish, pending client-provided assets and approvals.”

This prevents: “We can’t launch because photography isn’t done, so final payment waits.”

2) Clarify what counts as “core templates and systems implemented”
Your 40% milestone is good, but still slightly subjective. 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


A 1–2 line clarifier makes it bulletproof, like:

“Core templates = the agreed Phase 1 page types for each site (up to X).”

“Systems implemented = global styles applied, navigation/header/footer built, and gating/store templates functional.”

You don’t need to list every page—just define “core templates” as the agreed Phase 1 page types.

3) Add a simple change-order sentence
You already have: “Any work outside this scope requires written approval.” 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


That’s good. If you want one more layer of clarity, add:

“Written approval includes email confirmation of scope + fee/time impact.”

This stops “can you quickly…” from quietly expanding.

4) Termination clause: specify how partial work is priced
The Agreement says: “Client will pay for work completed through the termination date.” 
Consulting Services Agreement_S…


But it doesn’t say how you measure that (hourly? milestone percent?).

Fix options (pick one):

“Pro-rata to milestones achieved,” or

“At $X/hr against the remaining balance,” or

“Based on documented progress against deliverables.”

This avoids awkwardness if termination happens mid-milestone.

5) One subtle legal mismatch: Governing law is South Carolina
It says South Carolina governs the agreement. 
Consulting Services Agreement_S…


If that’s fine for you, ignore. If you’re in NY and she’s elsewhere, it’s worth confirming you’re comfortable with that.

My recommended “minimal edits” you can ask for
If you want to keep it ultra-light, ask her to revise only these:

Milestone 3: replace “at launch (site live)” with “at launch readiness / go-live” (wording above). 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


Milestone 2: add one clarifying sentence defining “core templates and systems.” 
Statement of Work_Stephen Campb…


Termination payment: add one sentence describing how partial milestone work is calculated. 
Consulting Services Agreement_S…


If you want, paste the exact wording you’d like for those 3 lines and I’ll rewrite them in the same tone as the document so you can send a clean “tiny edits” request to her.

You said:
now she wants to schedule a kick-off. what's a kick-off?
ChatGPT said:
A kickoff is the first official working meeting after the agreement is signed. Its purpose is to get everyone aligned and remove blockers so you can start building immediately.

Think of it as: “We’re live, here’s the plan, here are the owners, here are the deadlines, here’s what I need first.”

What you do in a kickoff (for this project)
1) Confirm Phase 1 scope in plain terms

Re-state what’s in and what’s out (no AI tool, no marketplace)

Confirm the Phase 1 page list and the “core templates” you’ll build

2) Lock the inputs + dependencies

Design partners: when you get the component/system spec (even v1)

Content/copy: what’s final vs placeholder

Photography: what’s arriving when (Lillier product shots especially)

3) Get access and environments set

Squarespace admin access (and agreement to duplicate for staging)

Shopify collaborator access and theme decision (Dawn-based or other)

Domain/DNS access if needed for launch

Any email/form destinations and tools

4) Decide architecture and editing workflow

How she (or her team) will add pages later

Membership gating rules for C+B

Lillier collection/category architecture

5) Agree on review cadence

When she reviews builds (weekly 20–30 min is typical)

Where feedback goes (one doc, Notion, email thread, etc.)

6) End with next steps

You leave with a checklist and dates, she leaves knowing what she owes you and when

What to ask her to bring to kickoff
Core page lists (even if rough)

Any WIP design system or component spec

Content folder links (copy + photos)

Product/collection architecture for Lillier (top-level categories)

What you should bring
Your milestone timeline to March 1

Your “section library” list (10–15 sections)

A short dependency checklist

A proposal for the weekly review rhythm

If you want, I can draft a tight kickoff agenda you can paste into an email, plus the exact questions to ask so you leave the meeting with everything you need.

You said:
how long should this meeting take?
ChatGPT said:
For this project, aim for 45 minutes.

30 minutes can work if it’s just you + her and the design system/page lists are already organized and ready to share.

60 minutes is worth it if design partners are joining, or if you need to lock page lists, membership gating, and Lillier collection architecture live.

A solid 45-minute kickoff agenda:

10 min: confirm Phase 1 scope + success criteria

15 min: dependencies (design system, content, photography) + dates

10 min: access/setup (Squarespace staging, Shopify theme, permissions)

5 min: review cadence + feedback workflow

5 min: recap + next steps (who does what by when)

If she offers a time slot, you can say: “45 minutes is perfect; happy to do 60 if the design partners will be present.”

You said:
Help me prepare for this kick-off. I've never done one before. I need all the help I can get. Thanks.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a complete kickoff “kit” you can use as-is: agenda, script, questions, and the exact outputs you should leave with. Keep it simple and calm. Your job is to turn “excited” into “scheduled and unblocked.”

1) Your goal for the kickoff (what success looks like)
By the end of the meeting you should have:

Final Phase 1 page list for each site (or a firm deadline for finalizing it)

Membership rules for C+B (what’s gated, how many tiers, pricing, and where the “Join” flow lives)

Lillier store architecture (collections/categories, product count at launch, must-have apps)

Design handoff plan (what you’re getting, when, and from whom)

Access (Squarespace admin, Shopify collaborator, shared folder)

A weekly review cadence + one feedback channel

A timeline with dates tied to dependencies (so March 1 stays realistic)

If you get those, you’re golden.

2) The meeting length + attendee setup
Ask for 45 minutes, or 60 if design partners join.

Attendees ideally:

Client (Amanda)

You

At least one design partner (optional but helpful)

Whoever owns copy/content files (if that’s not her)

3) Kickoff agenda (copy/paste to send)
You can send this in email or bring it as your own doc.

Kickoff Agenda (45 min)

Confirm Phase 1 scope + success criteria (5–8 min)

Inputs + dependencies and their dates (design system, copy, photography) (12–15 min)

C+B membership definition and gating list (8–10 min)

Lillier store architecture + launch essentials (8–10 min)

Access, working workflow, and weekly review cadence (5–7 min)

Recap decisions + next steps with owners and dates (2–3 min)

4) The script (what you say to lead confidently)
Use this verbatim.

Opening (30 seconds)
“Thanks for doing this. My goal today is to lock Phase 1 inputs and leave with a clear build plan, dates, and everything I need to start implementation immediately.”

Scope confirmation (1 minute)
“Just to confirm: Phase 1 is C+B on Squarespace with a clean, content-forward site and light membership gating, and Lillier is a standard Shopify store launch with single checkout. No marketplace behavior and no AI tool in Phase 1.”

Set the tone (10 seconds)
“I’ll keep us moving and capture decisions as we go.”

5) The questions to ask (in the right order)
A) Project-wide (dependencies + timing)
“Who is my point of contact for the design system handoff?”

“When will you have a v1 component/system spec ready, even if incomplete?”

“What’s the status of final copy? Is it locked or still being polished?”

“Photography: what’s the delivery schedule, and what’s acceptable as placeholder at launch?”

“What’s the single source of truth for feedback? (Google Doc, Notion, Figma comments, email)”

Decision you want: a date for design system v1 and a place for feedback.

B) Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace) membership and page system
“How many membership tiers in Phase 1: one tier or multiple tiers?”

“What’s gated at launch: which pages or resource collections?”

“Do members need anything beyond access? (downloads, newsletter, simple library page)”

“Is there any requirement for a member dashboard?”

You want her to say: “No, keep it light.”

“Do we have any existing member list/payment setup we must preserve, or are we starting fresh?”

Decision you want: tier count + gating list + whether you’re preserving anything existing.

Also ask:

“I recommend building in staging by duplicating the existing Squarespace site, then swapping at launch. Are you good with that?”

C) Lillier (Shopify) store architecture + launch essentials
“How many products at launch, roughly?”

“What’s the high-level collection/category architecture? (3–6 top collections)”

“Are there variants (size, color) or mostly single-SKU items?”

“Shipping/returns policy: do you have draft text already?”

“Any must-have apps for Phase 1, or should we keep it lean?”

Common Phase 1 essentials: email capture (Klaviyo or Shopify Email), reviews (optional), analytics/pixels (later if needed)

Decision you want: product count + collection architecture + “lean apps” commitment.

One strategic question because you noted “commission-based”:

“When you say commission-based, what’s the operational model in Phase 1, given we’re not doing marketplace behavior at launch?”
(You’re basically ensuring there’s no hidden expectation of vendor payouts/routing.)

6) What you should ask them to deliver after kickoff (with dates)
End the meeting by assigning owners:

By end of day / within 24 hours

Squarespace admin access + permission to duplicate site for staging

Shopify collaborator access

Shared folder link (copy + assets + photography)

By (date)

Page list final for each site

Design system v1 handoff

Gating list for C+B

Lillier collection architecture + initial product list

7) Your “kickoff doc” (make this as a single page)
Open a doc while you talk and fill it in live.

Kickoff Decisions

Phase 1 pages (C+B): …

Phase 1 pages (Lillier): …

Membership tiers + pricing: …

Gated content list: …

Shopify collection architecture: …

Design system v1 date + owner: …

Photography delivery date(s): …

Review cadence: weekly on ____ at ____

Feedback channel: ____

Launch target: March 1 (target), buffer plan: ____

When she sees you capturing it, she’ll trust the process.

8) The biggest pitfalls (avoid these)
Leaving membership vague (“we’ll decide later”) → leads to rebuild. Get tier count + gating list.

Letting “launch” depend on final photos/copy → define what can be placeholder.

No single feedback channel → you’ll get scattered edits and churn.

Apps/integrations creep on Shopify → keep Phase 1 lean.

9) Send a short kickoff confirmation email (template)
If you want to send something now:

Kickoff agenda + what I’ll need to start
Hi Amanda,

Excited to kick this off. A 45-minute kickoff is perfect.

My goal for the meeting is to confirm Phase 1 page lists, membership gating for C+B, Lillier store architecture, the design-system handoff timing, and leave with access + a clear build timeline to the March 1 target.

Proposed agenda:

Phase 1 scope + success criteria

Dependencies + dates (design system, copy, photography)

C+B membership tiers + gated content list

Lillier collections/products + Phase 1 app stack

Access + workflow + weekly review cadence

Next steps with owners and dates

If possible, it would help to have:

Links to the current C+B Squarespace site/admin invite

Shopify collaborator invite (or details on the store setup)

Any WIP design system / components spec

The current core page lists for both sites

Looking forward to it.
Stephen

If you tell me who’s attending (just her, or designers too) and how much time she proposed (30/45/60), I’ll tailor the agenda to match and tighten the questions so it fits perfectly.

You said:
I got the go daddy login used for both sites. and I got the login and a collaborator role on squarespace for c + b. lillier apparently not on spotify yet.  Anything else I need to refresh in my mind and be ready for at the front level of things for today's meeting?
ChatGPT said:
Nice — having GoDaddy + Squarespace collaborator already clears a bunch of the usual blockers. For today’s kickoff, here’s what to have “front-of-mind” so you look totally in control, without over-prepping.

What to be ready to decide today
1) Lillier Shopify setup path (since it’s not on Shopify yet)
You’ll want a clear recommendation ready:

Create Shopify store now (trial is fine) and add you as collaborator

Start from Dawn (or another OS2.0 theme only if there’s a strong reason)

Keep apps lean in Phase 1

What you want to leave with:

Who creates it (her or you), by when (ideally today), and you get access immediately.

2) Domain/DNS posture (you have GoDaddy)
Decide the launch approach so DNS isn’t a last-minute scramble:

For C+B (existing Squarespace URL): confirm if domain is already correctly connected and whether you’ll duplicate the site for staging.

For Lillier: confirm whether the domain exists already at GoDaddy and whether it will be:

connected directly to Shopify at launch, or

launched first on a Shopify subdomain, then swapped later.

Also decide: who will push DNS changes on launch day (you can, since you have the login, but confirm she’s comfortable).

3) “Core pages built” milestone definition (for the 30/40/30)
This is the biggest business-side thing to settle early because it prevents payment ambiguity:

Define “core pages built and ready for review” as:

global styles + header/footer + nav done

agreed page templates implemented (up to 5 per site)

C+B gating configured (even with placeholder content)

Shopify core templates functional (home, collection, product, content)

content can still be in-progress

If you bring this up calmly as “just so we’re aligned,” it reads as professional, not defensive.

4) C+B membership: “light” meaning in execution
Quick confirm:

# of tiers (1 vs multiple)

what is gated at launch (list or at least categories)

whether any existing members/data needs to be preserved (usually no, but ask)

5) Lillier architecture (don’t call it taxonomy)
Have a short prompt ready:

“What are the top 4–6 collections/categories we want at launch?”

“Rough product count?”

“Any variants?”

6) Design system handoff expectations
Since she said design partners will deliver a spec, set a simple requirement:

When you’ll get v1 tokens + component rules (even if incomplete)

Where it lives (Figma + a short written spec)

Who answers build questions (one owner)

7) Feedback + review workflow
Decide one channel:

single Google Doc / Notion page / Figma comments, and

weekly 20–30 min review slot.

What to do before the meeting (10-minute quick prep)
Log into GoDaddy and screenshot/notes:

domains present

nameservers (are they on GoDaddy default or already pointing elsewhere?)

Log into Squarespace

confirm site version (7.1)

find how you’ll duplicate for staging (or confirm you can)

Open a doc titled “Kickoff Decisions” with blanks:

Phase 1 page list (C+B / Lillier)

gating list

Lillier collection architecture

design handoff date

launch approach (DNS)

weekly review cadence

milestone 2 definition

Two “watch-outs” to keep in your pocket
If they say “March 1” but design/photos slip, you propose: launch with placeholders + strong templates rather than compressing QA.

For “commission-based” Lillier: gently confirm it’s standard store Phase 1 and commission mechanics are operational/admin, not a marketplace build.

If you tell me how long today’s kickoff is and who’s attending (just her vs designers too), I’ll condense this into a tight 1-page agenda + a closing recap script so you end the meeting with decisions and dates.

You said:
since it's not a marketplace build, how do you think commission actually operates in this case? so i can be prepared for that part.
You said:
Looks like c + b squarespace is using 7.1
ChatGPT said:
If it’s not a marketplace build (no vendor portals, no split payouts, no routing orders to sellers automatically), “commission-based” usually means the commission exists in the business + ops layer, not in the checkout experience.

Here are the most common ways that plays out on a “standard Shopify store launch,” and what it would mean for you technically.

1) Margin model (most common, simplest)
How it works: Lillier “takes commission” by setting the retail price above cost (wholesale pricing). The “commission” is effectively gross margin.

What the customer sees: totally normal store.

What ops does: track vendor COGS and pay vendors manually from reports.

Tech impact (Phase 1): basically none. Just make sure product data can store vendor + cost info (even if only in admin notes/metafields).

What to ask today:

“Are you buying wholesale / setting retail price above cost, and tracking margin as commission?”

2) Consignment / payout after purchase (still not marketplace, but needs discipline)
How it works: Customer buys from Lillier. Lillier later pays each vendor their share. There’s still a single checkout, but behind the scenes, order lines get attributed to vendors and payouts happen manually or via bookkeeping tools.

What the customer sees: normal store.

Tech impact (Phase 1): light-to-medium:

Add a Vendor field (Shopify has “vendor” built-in, plus you can add metafields).

Make sure order exports/reports can group by vendor (for payout).

You might add a simple internal workflow doc; maybe later an app.

What to ask today:

“Is the commission model consignment, meaning you’ll pay vendors after a sale? If yes, do you want vendor attribution at the product level on day one?”

3) Affiliate / referral (link-out checkout on the vendor’s site)
How it works: Lillier lists products, but “Buy” links out to the vendor’s own checkout using affiliate tracking.

What the customer sees: they leave Lillier to purchase elsewhere.

Tech impact (Phase 1): this is not a standard Shopify store experience anymore. It conflicts with “single checkout” unless used for a tiny subset.

What to ask today:

“Are we ever sending customers offsite to purchase, or is everything meant to checkout through Lillier?”

4) Commission as a “brand fee” (not tied per product sale)
How it works: Vendors pay a monthly/annual fee or placement fee. Shopify store is still standard; commission is handled by invoices/contracts.

Tech impact (Phase 1): none.

What to ask today:

“Is commission strictly tied to sales, or is it a placement/participation fee model?”

My best guess for your kickoff
Given her earlier email: “standard Shopify store launch with a single checkout and unified customer experience”, the most likely Phase 1 reality is either:

(1) margin model (wholesale → retail), or

(2) consignment payouts handled manually (vendor attribution needed, but no marketplace tech)

So the smart prep is: be ready to propose vendor attribution via product-level data (Vendor field + metafields) so commission/payout reporting is easy later, without building a vendor system now.

Two sentences you can use in the meeting
“Since Phase 1 is not a marketplace build, I’m assuming ‘commission-based’ is operational: either margin/wholesale pricing or consignment payouts handled internally. If we confirm which one, I can structure product data so reporting and payouts are clean without adding marketplace complexity.”

Re: C+B on Squarespace 7.1
Perfect. That means your plan of reusable section patterns + global CSS is viable, and you can keep the build “content-forward” without living in Fluid Engine all day.

If you tell me which commission option she confirms (margin vs consignment), I’ll give you the exact minimal Shopify data fields you should set up in Phase 1 so you’re future-proof for Phase 2 without doing extra work now.

Just got this from the client a minute before the kickoff. Need your notes on it asap.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Here are my fast, actionable notes on the copy doc she just sent, tuned for what you should say/decide in kickoff and what it implies technically.

1) Biggest flag: the copy calls Lillier a “marketplace” with “one cart checkout across multiple brands”
This language appears repeatedly (“one-stop marketplace,” “one cart. one checkout,” “one cart checkout across multiple Black-owned brands,” plus “items may ship separately from each brand”). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…

 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…

 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


That’s not automatically incompatible with “standard Shopify store launch,” but it creates an expectation that:

customers can buy products from multiple brands in one checkout (fine),

orders may split into multiple shipments (fine),

and implicitly there are multiple vendors behind the scenes (fine)…

…but it can sound like “marketplace behavior” unless you frame it clearly as:

“Curated multi-brand store with single checkout; vendors do not have portals; payouts/commission handled internally.”

What to ask on the call (30 seconds)
“The copy uses ‘marketplace’ and ‘one cart across multiple brands.’ For Phase 1, are we positioning this as a curated multi-brand store with one checkout, while vendor operations are handled internally (no vendor portals/payout automation yet)?”

This keeps brand promise consistent with her earlier email.

2) Shipping note needs a quick UX implementation decision
Copy says: “Items may ship separately from each brand.” 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


That’s good trust-building, but it means you should plan where it lives:

PDP (product page) near shipping info

Cart drawer/cart page as helper text

Checkout? (limited control in Shopify, but you can do cart messaging)

Kickoff prompt: “Where do you want that shipping note to appear: product page, cart, both?”

3) “Verified Black-owned business” trust line implies a data model (lightweight)
“This product is from a verified Black-owned business.” 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


If they want that to be true per product, you’ll need a simple structure:

Shopify “Vendor” field used consistently

Optional metafield like verified = true or a standard badge applied across all products (if everything is verified)

Kickoff prompt: “Is every brand on Lillier verified by default, or do we need a per-brand/per-product verification flag?”

4) Lillier category list = your initial collection architecture
They already gave categories: Household Essentials, Beauty/Personal Care, Food/Beverage, Home/Décor, Fashion/Accessories, Gifts/Stationery. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


That’s your Phase 1 structure. You should confirm:

Are these the top-level collections?

Do they want “Shop New Arrivals” and “Explore Brands” as key nav items? (both are CTAs) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Will there be a Brand directory and Brand stories section in Phase 1? (Brand Spotlight / story content appears strongly). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Kickoff prompt: “Do we need ‘Explore Brands’ and ‘Stories’ live in Phase 1, or can Brand Spotlight be a placeholder module until content is ready?”

5) C+B copy confirms “content-forward” and defines the key pages
C+B has clear page intent in the copy: Learn, Services, Community, Stories, plus Home. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


This is good: it’s basically your Phase 1 “5 page types” right there.

Implementation note for you (Squarespace 7.1):

This is classic editorial structure: strong type rhythm, simple sections, minimal layout trickery.

Membership gating likely applies to “Learn/Resources” content first. The copy mentions “tools, guidance, frameworks” and “resources.” 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Kickoff prompt: “Which parts of Learn/Resources are gated at launch vs public teasers?”

6) One more subtle alignment point: C+B says “community” a lot
C+B copy positions it as “education platform and community,” but Phase 1 is “light membership” and no heavy logic. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


So you should align expectations that “community” in Phase 1 might mean:

gated content + maybe a members-only page,

not a full forum/discussion platform.

Kickoff prompt: “For Phase 1, when we say ‘Join the Community,’ is that primarily membership access (gated resources/newsletter), with interactive community features later?”

7) What you should do immediately after kickoff with this copy
Treat this doc as:

Your IA confirmation (what pages exist and what sections are needed)

Your section library blueprint (hero, featured collections grid, spotlight, difference/value prop, CTA bands, story list, etc.)

Your microcopy placements (banner text, cart helper, shipping note, trust badge, footer line). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


A quick “kickoff-ready” summary you can say
“Copy looks strong and it actually helps lock Phase 1 IA. The one thing I want to align is that Lillier is written as a ‘marketplace’ with one cart across multiple brands and split shipping. That’s totally compatible with a standard Shopify launch as long as we’re clear it’s a curated multi-brand store in Phase 1, with vendor operations handled internally and no marketplace mechanics yet.”

If you want, tell me who’s in the kickoff (just her vs designers too), and I’ll give you a 5-minute “talk track” to steer the meeting so this marketplace wording doesn’t accidentally expand scope.

I got the following live notes from our kickoff meeting.

My role is building the infrastructure of these sites and we will be using imagery as placeholders 
c and b is in final form going to have ai as tailored personality for black entrepreneurs - access to library of content and tools - viable subscription model - want it to look very sexy - one thing she’s done over the 8 years of c and b is host dinner parties, blind dinner parties for like 15 diff people who didn’t know each other, and they only knew her, so she connected them and cross pollinated, as a natural networking event with home cooking and real conversations at a home 

at one tier, unlocks invitations to these blind dinner parties. using imagery from these dinner parties is a good thing to feature prominently - as phase 1, because the designer is not hired yet, so we are using placeholders
working with warry bice (sp?) lives in LA, is a celebrity stylist

LILLIER 
is your one stop shopping place for black owned products - target is black consumer, with secondary emphasis on latino, queer, hip young white audience 

LILLIER as black as fuck, unapologetically
very intentionally black, no token white
very powerful message to black folks 

BOTH SITES

unified sense and sensibility

different uses and intents

lillier is self care items for black customers for everything from lip balm to beard oil etc

while c and b is for all black folks looking to start their busienss and want support /community

she wants both sites to look editorial, edgy and chic

she likes luxury brands, their sites looks and functions, yet she wants very editorial, chic, thoughtful, high end and aspirational

imagery in the brief - is weird, interesting, luxury, patternation, deliberate evoke african cloth

lillier she wants to be a black amazon - she wants packaging to be part of the branding

she loves amazon and was an early adopter of the lifestyle

she saw that other neighbors in her building adopted the lifestyle because she did, and her boxes piled up as marketing tool for others

packaging not looking like imagery in brief YET for phase 1, but for phase 2 it may

she wants the packaging to be artwork! - a chance to showcase original artwork

dior fashion and dior beauty websites have different purposes but the conncetion should be subtle, not overt - similar relationship between c and b and lillier

step 1 set up shopify account
step 1 clone existing cupcakes and broccoli

take time looking at brief - one of the women in the brief imagery might be a soap maker - and we take her photo in a cool, chic, fashionable way for the style of it all

priorities for site = mobile first = ESSENTIAL
	-shared dna for sites (on c and b site, not one landing page where it’s split, but visually she likes that)
	- for the long haul, organize and label well for the next ten years about how the user experience is going to be = keep clean for long term future
ChatGPT said:
These are strong kickoff notes. You got three critical things clarified that should guide everything you do next:

Phase 1 is infrastructure + placeholders (designer not hired yet)

Both sites must feel editorial/luxury/chic and mobile-first

The relationship between brands is subtle “shared DNA,” not overt linking

Below are my comments + the immediate next steps I’d lock today.

Key takeaways and what they mean technically
1) Your role = “infrastructure builder” (this is good)
This supports your whole approach: build reusable structure, clean templates, section system, naming conventions, and a long-term editing workflow. It also means you should push for:

tight section library

consistent spacing/type rhythm

clean naming and documentation

Your last bullet (“organize and label well for 10 years”) is basically your permission to be opinionated about structure.

2) Placeholder imagery is not “temporary hack,” it’s Phase 1 strategy
So don’t over-invest in art direction right now. What you do invest in:

image aspect ratio rules (so later photos drop in cleanly)

consistent cropping guidelines

a “media library” structure (folders, names, and usage notes)

3) C+B tier includes dinner party invitations
That’s a membership value prop that can live content-forward without building “community software.”

Phase 1 can handle this with:

a “Members” page explaining benefits

a gated page with “Dinner Series” info + simple RSVP form (even if manual)

featured photography from dinners as a hero/feature module (placeholder now, stronger later)

Important: RSVP mechanics can be Phase 1-light (embedded form + manual list). No need to build an event platform.

4) Lillier “black as fuck” + “black Amazon” is messaging, not marketplace tech (yet)
You should treat this as:

multi-brand curated store, one checkout

brand storytelling modules (“Brand spotlight”) that feel like editorial

packaging as brand asset later (Phase 2), but don’t build packaging-heavy flows now

5) “Dior fashion vs Dior beauty” reference is a systems cue
It’s a clear instruction:

shared typography/spacings/interaction style

different layout emphasis and content blocks

subtle cross-links (footer, small nav item, or “family” mark), not a big hub page

Things to clarify soon (not necessarily in the next call, but in writing)
These are the only items in your notes that can cause scope drift if not pinned down:

Membership tiers count + pricing (C+B)

What is gated in Phase 1 (specific pages/sections)

Dinner invitations workflow: form + manual list vs email tool vs calendar tool

Lillier product count + collection architecture (you have a rough idea, but get numbers)

Who provides placeholder imagery now and where it lives (folder link)

If you get these written down in a follow-up email, you’ll avoid “we thought you were building X.”

Immediate next steps (what you should do now)
Step 1: Shopify store creation (today)
Have her create it or you create it with her present.

Add you as collaborator immediately.

Decide theme starting point: Dawn unless a designer insists otherwise later.

Step 2: Clone C+B Squarespace site (today)
Duplicate the existing site to staging.

Confirm Squarespace 7.1 (you already did).

Set a “do not edit live site” rule until launch.

Step 3: Write the “Phase 1 build map” (1 page)
This is your internal operating doc:

Page types (5 max each site)

Section library (10–12 sections)

Placeholder imagery rules

Naming conventions

What “core pages ready for review” means (ties to the 40% milestone)

Step 4: Lock mobile-first rules
Decide up front:

one primary column width for editorial text

image aspect ratios by use-case (hero, card, spotlight)

tap targets, nav behavior, and spacing scale

This prevents you from reworking everything later.

What I recommend you send her today (short follow-up)
If you want, you can send this:

Confirm you will set up Shopify + duplicate C+B.

Confirm Phase 1 uses placeholders.

Ask for a shared drive/folder for images (dinner photos + product shots).

Ask for membership tier/pricing + gating list, even if provisional.

If you paste the email thread context, I’ll draft the exact message in her tone.

One caution
The phrase “black Amazon” is a powerful north star, but it can accidentally pull people toward marketplace expectations. Keep repeating the Phase 1 reality:

“curated multi-brand store”

“single checkout”

“vendor operations handled internally”

“marketplace mechanics later, if desired”

That protects scope while preserving the vibe.

If you want, I can convert your kickoff notes into a clean Kickoff Summary + Action Items doc (owners + dates) that you can send her and copy into your project tracker.

Uploaded image
Client shared a google drive older with me where I can see one photo in the outermost dir, but all inner dirs appear empty. am i missing some permission, or what?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 8s
Yeah — that pattern (you can see the folder names, but they look empty) is usually one of these Drive quirks:

Most likely causes
1) You have access to the parent folder, but not the contents inside
This happens when files/subfolders were shared with different rules (or were moved in from somewhere else and didn’t inherit permissions the way you’d expect). Drive often shows the folder as “empty” instead of telling you “no access.”

Quick test: open one of the “empty” folders and look at the top-right:

if you see a Request access button or a banner, it’s permissions.

if no banner, still could be restricted contents.

Fix (client side):
Have her open the parent folder → Share → add your email explicitly (not just link) → ensure it applies to everything inside.

2) Those inner folders are shortcuts to other folders you don’t have access to
Shortcuts can appear inside a shared folder, but you may not have permission to the shortcut target.

Quick test: right-click one “empty” folder → View details
If it says Type: Shortcut, that’s the explanation.

Fix: she needs to share the actual target folder with you (or replace shortcuts with real folders/files inside the shared folder).

3) It’s a Shared Drive / restricted container
If she’s using a Workspace Shared Drive with tight policies, sharing a folder to an external collaborator can show structure but block contents depending on org settings.

Quick test: in the folder header, does it say it’s in a Shared drive (not “My Drive”)?

Fix: she may need to:

add you as a member of the Shared Drive (Viewer/Commenter is fine), or

move the photo library into “My Drive” and share from there.

4) The folders are genuinely empty (placeholders)
Sometimes they’ve created structure but haven’t moved the files in yet. The one image in the root is a clue this could be the case.

Quick test: use Drive search within the folder for jpg or png.
If zero results, it may truly be empty.

What I’d do in 2 minutes (your side)
Open one “empty” folder → refresh → try List view (sometimes grid doesn’t render items instantly).

Right-click → View details → check if it’s a shortcut.

In that folder, search: type:image or jpg.

Check if you see any “limited access” indicators.

A simple message to send her (fast + non-accusatory)
“Thanks for sharing the photo library. I can see the folder structure, but the subfolders are showing as empty on my end (I only see one image in the root). This usually happens when the inner folders/files don’t inherit permissions or some of the folders are shortcuts to locations I don’t have access to. Could you either (1) re-share the top folder with my email ensuring it applies to everything inside, or (2) confirm whether those subfolders are shortcuts / in a Shared Drive?”

If you tell me whether the folder lives in My Drive or a Shared drive, and whether “View details” shows Shortcut, I’ll tell you exactly which fix is the right one.

You said:
how to apply share permission with all subfolders, when sending permission to a certain email?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the clean way to do it in Google Drive, plus what to do if it still doesn’t cascade.

The normal way (works if inheritance is allowed)
If it’s in My Drive
Right-click the top-level folder → Share

In Add people and groups, enter the email

Choose role (Viewer/Commenter/Editor)

Click the gear icon (settings) if needed:

(Optional) disable “Editors can change permissions…” etc.

Click Send

This should give that email access to everything inside the folder that inherits permissions.

If it doesn’t apply to everything (common causes + fixes)
A) Some subfolders/files have unique permissions
Those items won’t inherit from the parent.

Fix (client side):

Open one of the “empty” subfolders

Right-click → Share

If it shows “Restricted” or different people, it has unique perms

Add your email there too (or reset sharing by removing restrictions)

There isn’t a perfect “force propagate to all descendants” button in consumer Drive UI. The practical fix is: make sure items aren’t uniquely restricted, or use an admin/workspace tool if they have one.

B) The subfolders are Shortcuts
Sharing the parent folder doesn’t grant access to the shortcut target.

Fix: Share the actual target folder (or move the real folders/files into the shared parent, not shortcuts).

C) It’s inside a Shared Drive
Sharing behaves differently and may be governed by Workspace policy.

Fix options:

Add you as a member of the Shared Drive, or

Move/copy the asset folders into My Drive and share from there.

Best “quick verification” step for them
After sharing the top folder, have them:

Open one subfolder

Right-click → Share

Confirm your email appears under “People with access”

If your email shows there but you still see empty, it’s usually shortcuts or a Shared Drive restriction.

If you want a one-line instruction you can paste to the client
“Please share the top-level PHOTO LIBRARY folder directly to my email (not link-only), then open one of the inner folders and confirm my email appears under ‘People with access.’ If the inner folders are shortcuts or in a Shared Drive, you’ll need to share the shortcut targets / add me to the Shared Drive as well.”

If you want, tell me whether that photo library folder is in My Drive or a Shared drive, and I’ll give the exact simplest fix for that case.

PDF
What I really need is for you to extract all relevant information from the following document that the client gave us during the kickoff. It should answer some of our questions, but others may remain. Let me know what you learn:
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Here’s everything actionable and relevant I can extract from the Website Copy WIP doc, organized by what it answers for Phase 1 build decisions and what it still leaves open. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


What we learn for Lillier (Shopify)
Positioning + promise
Brand promise is crystal: “Shop Black. Every day. All in one cart.” (hero + global banner) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…

 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Copy explicitly calls Lillier a “one-stop marketplace” and says “one cart checkout across multiple Black-owned brands.” 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…

 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Implication for you (Phase 1): you must implement Shopify as a multi-brand curated shop with a single checkout, while operationally handling vendors internally. The copy is already “marketplace-y,” so your UX microcopy needs to clarify shipping + brand attribution.

Homepage structure is basically defined
The homepage is explicitly laid out into modules:

Hero (headline/subhead/body + 2 CTAs: Shop New Arrivals / Explore Brands) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Featured Collections (“Shop by Category” + “Browse All Collections”) with 6 categories listed 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Brand Spotlight / Stories module (“Explore More Stories”) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


The Lillier Difference module (“Learn More About Lillier”) including the key support points 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Closing CTA (“Shop Now”) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Collections / architecture (they call it “taxonomy” but you’re using “architecture”)
The doc gives the top-level shopping architecture explicitly:

Household Essentials

Beauty and Personal Care

Food and Beverage

Home and Décor

Fashion and Accessories

Gifts and Stationery 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


About page content is basically complete
“Our Story” explains the pain: shopping Black means multiple sites, multiple orders, multiple shipping; “convenience wins.” Lillier solves via one cart / one checkout. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


“Why Lillier Exists” explains distribution/visibility barriers and the platform goal. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Naming story: founder’s grandmother “Lillier Madison” and ownership = joy. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Required utility copy (this turns into UI requirements)
Global banner text exists 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Cart helper text exists 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Shipping note exists: items may ship separately 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Trust line exists: verified Black-owned business 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Footer line exists 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Implications:

You should plan placements: banner (sitewide), cart helper (cart page/drawer), shipping note (cart + PDP), trust line (PDP badge), footer line (sitewide footer).

What we learn for Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace)
“Content-forward” is confirmed by the copy itself
The site is framed as:

“education platform and community”

practical tools, guidance, frameworks

stories as honest motivation 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


This strongly supports: editorial layouts, minimal UI chrome, clear page hierarchy, strong type.

The Phase 1 page list is basically defined
The copy explicitly defines these page types and their purpose:

Homepage (positioning + CTAs) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Learn page (resources) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Services page (execution + accountability) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Community page (momentum/accountability/shared learning) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Stories page (story index + CTA “Start Reading”) 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…

 (continues through end)

CTAs are defined (you can design around these)
Homepage CTAs: Explore Resources / Join the Community 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Learn CTA: Explore Resources 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Community CTA: Join the Community 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Stories CTA: Start Reading 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


What this doc answers vs what it doesn’t
Answered
Core IA/page types for both sites (enough to build Phase 1 skeletons). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…

 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Top-level shop architecture for Lillier (6 categories). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Required homepage modules for Lillier (clear section list). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Key UI microcopy for Lillier (banner/cart/shipping/trust/footer). 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Confirms “content-forward” = editorial education + story content for C+B. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Still open / needs confirmation
These are the items the doc does not specify, and they matter to build:

Lillier

Is “Explore Brands” a brand directory page? (and what’s its layout: grid, filter, A–Z, featured stories?) Copy implies it but doesn’t define the page. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


How are “Stories” implemented in Shopify Phase 1? Blog? Pages? Metaobjects? The copy promises monthly spotlights. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Verification: is every brand verified by default, or do you need a per-brand flag to show the trust line accurately? 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Shipping reality: “may ship separately” implies multi-origin fulfillment. Is Lillier stocking inventory centrally (one shipping origin) or shipping from brands (multiple origins)? 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Scale claim (“thousands of verified businesses”): is that Phase 1 reality or aspirational copy? It affects expectations. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


C+B

What exactly is gated in Phase 1? The doc doesn’t specify which resources/pages are members-only. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


What does “Join the Community” lead to in Phase 1? Simple membership checkout + members-only page? Or email capture? The doc doesn’t say. 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Stories content model: are stories just a blog? Who writes them? How many at launch? 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


The two biggest “scope risk” sentences in the doc (so you can manage expectations)
“One cart checkout across multiple Black-owned brands” 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


“Items may ship separately from each brand.” 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


These are totally doable without marketplace software, but they force you to implement clean brand attribution + shipping messaging.

If you want, paste (or upload) whatever “more info” she said she would send next, and I’ll reconcile it against this doc and your kickoff notes into a single Phase 1 build checklist (pages + sections + data models) for Shopify and Squarespace.

If you want, I can turn this into a “Phase 1 sitemap” with (a) the confirmed pages above and (b) the implied pages you should propose to her as part of Shopify’s standard store structure (Product page, Collection page, Cart, Search, etc.) without accidentally expanding scope.


Sources
You said:
Do we have this info from anywhere yet? 
Membership tiers + pricing: …


Gated content list: …
ChatGPT said:
Not yet.

From what you’ve shared and the docs we’ve reviewed:

The client has only said “light membership functionality” for C+B and “subscription based” business model in your notes, but no tier names, number of tiers, prices, or benefits are specified anywhere we’ve seen (brief, her email, kickoff notes, or the Website Copy WIP doc).

The materials also do not specify what is gated (which pages/sections/resources), only that gated content exists / community membership is a CTA.

So both of these are still open items you need her to define (even if provisional for Phase 1).

What you can do now without those answers:

Build the Squarespace structure so gating can be applied later (members area + placeholder “Members” page + a couple sample gated pages).

Define a “gating pattern” (lock icon, teaser excerpt, CTA to join) and apply it consistently.

If you want, I’ll draft a tight message to her that asks for exactly the minimum decisions needed to keep Phase 1 moving (number of tiers + price range + what’s gated at launch), without making it feel like you’re pushing scope.

You said:
Let's gather up our questions for the client. Ask client to confirm pages per site after listing the evident ones we see, ask what pages are membership gated on C + B, ask for explicit email invite to photos folders rather than general link sharing for the folders...what else am I missing?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a tight “questions bundle” you can send that covers what you listed plus the other high-leverage items that will unblock build decisions and prevent scope creep. I’m writing it as a client-facing message, with the “evident pages” listed first.

Quick confirmations to lock Phase 1 build (pages, gating, assets, Shopify setup)
Hi Amanda,

A few quick confirmations so I can lock the Phase 1 build plan and start implementing cleanly on both platforms.

Lillier (Shopify)

Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace)

Can you confirm if this is the complete Phase 1 page list, and call out any additions you want included in Phase 1 (even if content is placeholder)?

C+B membership: gating + tiers

Which pages/sections/resources are gated at launch (exact list)?

How many tiers in Phase 1 (one vs multiple), and what’s the pricing (even provisional)?

“Join the Community” should lead to what in Phase 1: membership checkout + members-only content, or an interim signup flow?

Photo/asset access
I can see the outer folder and one image, but the inner folders show as empty on my end. This usually happens when subfolders/files don’t inherit permissions or they’re shortcuts to locations I don’t have access to.

Can you share the photo folders to my email directly (explicit invite), rather than link-only sharing, and ensure it applies to subfolders/files?

Shopify setup (Lillier)
Since Lillier isn’t set up on Shopify yet:

Who should create the Shopify store (you or me), and can we do that today?

Once it’s created, please add me as a collaborator/admin (or equivalent) so I can begin theme implementation.

Lillier “multi-brand” operations (to keep copy and build aligned)
The copy references one cart/one checkout across multiple brands and notes that items may ship separately.
For Phase 1, can you confirm this is a curated multi-brand store with a single checkout, while vendor operations (commission/payout/shipping coordination) are handled internally for now (no vendor portals or marketplace mechanics in Phase 1)?

Design system handoff

When will we receive a v1 component/system spec (even if incomplete), and who is the point person for build questions?

Where should I look for updates (Figma link + any written spec)?

If you reply with quick bullets, I’ll finalize the Phase 1 sitemap, section library, and timeline immediately and start building.

Thanks,
Stephen

If you want to tighten it further, the only optional items to drop are #6 (design system handoff) or #5 (multi-brand ops). But I’d keep both because they prevent rework and scope confusion.

You said:
Cut 4, 5, and 6. cut the question about tiers for membership. Do not use bullet points. Use - instead.

3. Photo asset access
In some of the shared folder links, I can see the outer folder content, but the inner folders show as empty. This usually happens when subfolders/files don’t inherit permissions. It should be overcome with an explicit email invitation to my gmail, rather than a general copy + paste of the drive folder link.
Can you please share the photo folders to my email directly (explicit invite to my gmail), rather than the current,  copy + pasted link sharing?
Thank you!
Best,

But based on these words of the client's in the email where she shared all the kick off resources, what else am I failing to ask / answer at this time: `My goal for Phase 1 is to get both sites to a strong, clean, launch ready place with mobile first thinking, clear structure, and systems I can easily update myself.
Once you’ve had a chance to review, I’d love your initial thoughts on:
Overall approach and sequencing
Any early questions or flags
A rough estimate and timeline for Phase 1
ChatGPT said:
You’re covering the immediate blockers (pages, gating, photo permissions). What you’re missing, based on her note, are the three things she explicitly asked you to respond to: approach/sequencing, early flags, and a rough timeline. You don’t need more questions to her for those; you need to answer them with a short, confident plan.

Also, you’re not yet asking for one key dependency that directly affects your ability to give a timeline: design system handoff timing (even if the designer isn’t hired, she may have direction or a WIP spec). Without that, your timeline can’t be meaningfully grounded.

Below is a streamlined way to add what’s missing without making your email longer or more complex.

What else you should add (in plain terms)
A short “Here’s how I propose we sequence Phase 1” (so you’re answering her ask)

One “early flags” paragraph (placeholders, membership ambiguity, Shopify not set up yet, Drive permissions)

A rough Phase 1 timeline estimate (with a dependency caveat)

One quick ask: when you’ll receive any design direction/spec (or confirmation you should proceed with a pragmatic baseline system)

Here’s your email, with a minimal add-on (keeps your tone and keeps it tight). I used - formatting like you’ve been doing.

Phase 1 confirmations + initial approach/timeline
Hi Amanda,

Hope you had an excellent long weekend!

I just have a few quick questions so I can lock the Phase 1 build plan and start implementing cleanly on both platforms.

Confirmation on Phase 1 pages (based on the Website Copy WIP)

Lillier (Shopify)

Home

About

Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace)

Home

Learn

Services

Community

Stories

Can you confirm if this is the complete Phase 1 page list, and call out any additions you want included in Phase 1? For Lillier especially, I don’t want to assume and then have to redo.

C+B membership gating

Which pages/sections/resources are gated behind membership at launch?

“Join the Community” should lead to what in Phase 1: membership checkout + members-only content, or an interim signup flow?

Photo asset access

In some of the shared folder links, I can see the outer folder content, but the inner folders show as empty. This usually happens when subfolders/files don’t inherit permissions.

Can you share the photo folders to my email directly (explicit invite to my Gmail), rather than link-only sharing?

Also, to answer the points you raised about Phase 1:

Overall approach and sequencing (proposed)

Set up Shopify for Lillier and duplicate/clone the existing C+B Squarespace site so we can work safely in staging

Implement the shared “DNA” system first (type, spacing, buttons, basic layout rules), then build core templates and navigation

Drop in copy and placeholder imagery to get both sites reviewable quickly on mobile

Polish/QA pass, then launch

Early questions/flags (so we stay efficient)

Membership gating needs a clear list so I don’t wire the wrong pages/sections behind login

Since we’re using placeholder imagery for now, I’ll standardize image ratios/placements so final photography can be swapped in cleanly later

For design direction, if the designer/system spec is still in flight, I can start with a pragmatic baseline system and refine once the spec lands. If you have any WIP system notes or references you want me aligned to, please send them over.

Rough estimate and timeline for Phase 1

Once I have the confirmed page list, gating list, and working asset access, I can get both sites into a strong “core pages built and ready for review” state within about 2–3 weeks, then allocate another 1–2 weeks for content fit/polish, QA, and launch readiness (depending on how quickly final photography/content lands).

Thank you!
Best,
Stephen

If you want to be extra safe: replace “2–3 weeks” / “1–2 weeks” with a single range (“~4–5 weeks total”) so she doesn’t anchor on the fastest case.

You said:
What about the point of clarity regarding how the shopify will work phase 1?
ChatGPT said:
You should absolutely add one short “Shopify Phase 1 clarity” section, because the copy uses “marketplace / multi-brand” language and you want to lock expectations early without reopening the marketplace scope.

What you want her to confirm is not “how to build a marketplace,” but simply:

Single Shopify store, single checkout

Products from multiple brands are sold through Lillier

No vendor portals/logins

No automated split payouts / routing orders to vendors

Shipping reality (central fulfillment vs multi-origin / “may ship separately”)

Here’s the cleanest way to add it to your email (keeps tone friendly, doesn’t feel defensive):

Lillier Shopify Phase 1 (quick confirmation)

The copy positions Lillier as “one cart / one checkout across multiple brands,” which is great. To keep Phase 1 aligned with “standard Shopify store launch,” can you confirm:

This is one Shopify store with one checkout, selling products from multiple brands under the Lillier umbrella

No vendor portals/logins and no automated vendor payouts/order routing in Phase 1 (handled internally for now)

Shipping in Phase 1: are orders fulfilled from one place, or should we expect multi-origin shipments (the copy notes items may ship separately)?

If you’d rather keep the email even shorter, you can compress the Shopify confirmation into a single sentence like: “Can you confirm Phase 1 is a single Shopify store with one checkout, with multi-brand ops handled internally (no vendor portals/payout automation yet), and clarify whether shipping is single-origin or may be multi-origin?”

You said:
For the shopify, I just want to know that there is no expectation in phase 1 to plug in multipler other virtual storefronts, or if that is a goal, then they need to be on shopify for this to be feasible, because plugging in a whole panoply of varied digital storefront formats under one umbrella is a nightmare of backend fuckery.
ChatGPT said:
You’re right to pin this down now. The clean way to say it to her is: Phase 1 is one Shopify store, and any “multi-brand” inventory is either (a) stocked/managed inside that store, or (b) comes from Shopify-native partner flows where vendors are on Shopify (or you’ll otherwise need a separate, explicitly scoped integration project).

Here are two client-ready ways to express it, without sounding alarmist.

Option A (neutral, professional, clear)
Email
Subject
Lillier Phase 1 Shopify clarification
Hi Amanda,

One quick clarification on Lillier for Phase 1, just to keep expectations aligned with a standard Shopify store build.

For Phase 1, I’m assuming Lillier is a single Shopify store where products are managed inside that store (even if they’re from multiple brands), with a single checkout.

I want to confirm there’s no Phase 1 expectation to “plug in” or aggregate inventory directly from hundreds of separate external storefronts in different formats. If multi-storefront aggregation is a future goal, it becomes feasible (and far less complex) when partner brands are on Shopify or are using a Shopify-compatible workflow, and we’d treat that as a separately scoped Phase 2 integration.

Does that match your intent for Phase 1?

Thanks,
Stephen

Option B (a bit more direct, still polite)
Email
Subject
Lillier Phase 1 Shopify clarification
Hi Amanda,

Quick check so Phase 1 stays clean and launchable.

For Phase 1, I’m treating Lillier as a single Shopify store with one checkout, where products are managed inside Shopify. I just want to confirm there’s no Phase 1 requirement to aggregate inventory directly from lots of external storefronts across different platforms. If that’s a future direction, it’s much more feasible when partner brands are also on Shopify (or using a Shopify-native workflow), and it should be scoped as a Phase 2 integration.

Does that align with how you’re thinking about Phase 1?

Thanks,
Stephen

If you tell me her tone (more formal vs casual), I’ll tune this to match perfectly.

To answer the points you raised about Phase 1:
4. Overall approach and sequencing (suggested)
Set up Shopify for Lillier and duplicate/clone the existing C+B Squarespace site so we can work safely in staging


Implement the shared “DNA” system first (type, spacing, buttons, basic layout rules), then build core templates and navigation


Drop in copy and placeholder imagery to get both sites reviewable quickly on mobile


Polish/QA pass, then launch
5. Early flags:
For Phase 1, I understand Lillier is a single Shopify store where products are managed inside that store (even if they’re from multiple brands), with a single checkout


I just want to confirm there’s no Phase 1 expectation to “plug in” or aggregate inventory directly from hundreds of separate external storefronts in different digital formats


If multi-storefront aggregation is a future Phase 2-scoped goal, it becomes realistically feasible (and far less complex) when partner brands are on Shopify too


Does that match your intent for Phase 1?
6. Rough estimate and timeline for Phase 1
Once I have the confirmed page list, membership-gated page list, and working photo asset access, I can get into full swing! Given four to five weeks, I am confident I can deliver on our enumerated Phase 1 goals.
Thanks for taking the time Amanda, and please let me know your thoughts on any of the above, when it’s convenient!

Can you confirm this is the complete Phase 1 page list, and call out any additions you want included in Phase 1? For Lillier especially, I want to avoid assuming and then having to rework structure later.

C+B membership gating

Which pages/sections/resources are gated behind membership at launch (exact list)?

In Phase 1, should “Join the Community” lead to membership checkout + members-only content, or an interim signup flow?

Placeholder photo asset access

In some of the shared Drive folders, I can see the outer folder but the inner folders appear empty. This typically happens when subfolders/files don’t inherit permissions.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds

Thought for 42s
Got it — these two docs add real scope-defining constraints (and also surface a couple potential conflicts with earlier assumptions). Here are the key takeaways and what deserves the most attention right now.

Step 1: What these docs now lock down
Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace): the sitemap is no longer “5 pages”
This doc defines a full Phase 1 top nav:

Home

About

Work With Amanda

Learn

Stories

Blind Dinners

Membership

Login (with a persistent Login button in the header) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


This is a major clarification versus the earlier “Home/Learn/Services/Community/Stories” model.

C+B: Membership is now explicitly defined (tiers + pricing + what login should/shouldn’t do)
The membership page copy includes:

Core Membership: $25/month

Premium Membership: $59/month 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


And there’s an “internal implementation brief for Stephen” that clearly defines Phase 1 membership/login behavior:

Email + password only, no social login 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


No dashboard; login is for access control only 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


If user logs in directly → route to Home; if they hit a gated page → return to that page 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


No AI history, no download tracking, no personalization in Phase 1 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


This is excellent because it prevents “SaaS creep.”

C+B: The AI Concierge is treated as a real Phase 1 interaction pattern
The doc specifies a UX requirement:

AI opens as overlay/modal from Home

User does not navigate away

Closing returns them to the same scroll position 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


This is a technical requirement (custom JS behavior), even if the AI backend is placeholder initially.

Lillier (Shopify): navigation + taxonomy are now tightly constrained
Top-level nav is explicitly:

Home

Shop

Brands

About
(No other top-level items in Phase 1.) 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Under “Shop,” only four primary categories exist at launch:

Home

Beauty

Pantry

Pet 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Subcategories exist, but are intended as collections and/or filters, not main nav items. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Lillier: what “curated marketplace” means operationally (and for data structure)
Key constraints:

Each brand gets a limited, selected set of SKUs, not its full catalog 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Brands should be assigned one primary category for Phase 1 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Brands page should feel editorial, not directory-like; brand pages include story/short description + selected SKUs, and brands may be filterable by category 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Lillier: explicit Phase 1 exclusions (this protects you)
Out of scope for Phase 1 includes:

Full brand catalog exports

Gifts as a top-level category

Editorial/Journal sections

Ingredient-led or mood-based navigation

Additional top-level nav items 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Step 2: The two biggest things you must give greatest attention now
Priority A: Reconcile conflicts across materials before you build the wrong structure
There are two likely mismatches you should flag immediately:

C+B page set changed
Earlier, “Services” and “Community” were implied in copy; this new nav doc replaces that with Work With Amanda and elevates Blind Dinners and Membership as first-class pages. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


➡️ You should treat the new nav doc as the source of truth and ask Amanda to confirm “Services/Community” are not Phase 1 nav items (or whether they’re folded into other pages).

Lillier category set changed
Earlier WIP copy listed more categories (fashion, gifts, etc.). This new taxonomy says only 4 primary shop categories, and explicitly says Gifts is out of scope as a top-level category.
➡️ This is a “copy alignment” task: homepage “Featured Collections” and “Shop by Category” must match these 4.

Priority B: Decide what “Phase 1 AI Concierge” actually means (real vs placeholder)
Your kickoff notes earlier said “AI tool later phase,” but this new doc gives very specific Phase 1 UX requirements for the AI concierge (modal behavior) plus membership-based access differences.
➡️ You need a clear client call on whether Phase 1 includes:

A real working AI concierge, or

A designed placeholder modal that says “coming soon” / captures interest, while preserving the intended UX pattern.

This is the single highest-risk scope ambiguity now.

Step 3: What to build next (practical, high-leverage checklist)
Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace 7.1)
Implement the top-level nav exactly as specified + persistent Login button. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Create the page templates for: Home, About, Work With Amanda, Learn, Stories, Blind Dinners, Membership, Login. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Membership setup:

Implement Core ($25) and Premium ($59) and gate content accordingly. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Login behavior and gating rules as written (no dashboard; return-to-gated-page; minimal login page). 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


AI Concierge:

Build the modal/overlay behavior (even if the inner AI is placeholder), because the UX pattern is specified. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Lillier (Shopify)
Implement nav: Home / Shop / Brands / About only. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Implement Shop category structure: Home / Beauty / Pantry / Pet. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Implement subcategories as collections/filters, not nav items (Search & Discovery + storefront filters). 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Build an editorial Brands index + brand detail pages with story + curated SKUs; filter brands by primary category. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Keep out-of-scope items out of IA and builds (Journal, Gifts top-level, etc.). 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


The clarifying questions that remain (now much fewer)
These are the only remaining “must-answer” items I’d surface:

For C+B, what specific Learn/Stories items are gated vs public (now that tiers are defined)? 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Is AI Concierge functional in Phase 1 or a UI placeholder modal (with real build later)? 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


For Lillier, confirm homepage category modules reflect only the 4 primary shop categories (Home/Beauty/Pantry/Pet). 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


If you want, paste your current working sitemap/IA for both sites and I’ll mark it up line-by-line against these docs (what matches, what to change, what to delete).

Let's focus our attention ow on how to plan to build the two sites most efficiently. We want to use our time wisely, economically. What in your professional opinion is the best approach here? Compare and contrast to reach your conclusions, pushing yourself to develop the best plan you can here. Take your time, and think step by step. Do not hurry to finish. The more time we take now to plan, the better we can execute the plan later i a timely fashion. Thank you.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a second

Thought for 18s
The most efficient way to build these two different platforms without doing everything twice is not “one shared codebase” in the traditional sense (Squarespace + Shopify won’t let you truly share templates/components cleanly), but a shared design-system layer + shared content patterns, then a thin platform-specific implementation layer.

That gives you maximum reuse while staying realistic about each platform’s constraints.

Below is the approach I’d use, with comparisons so the reasoning is clear, then a step-by-step execution plan.

Compare and contrast: 3 ways to do this
Option 1: Build both sites separately inside each platform
Pros

Fast start, low tooling overhead.

Cons

You duplicate decisions constantly (spacing/type/buttons/cards/nav behavior).

Rework multiplies when design changes.

Harder to keep the “shared DNA” consistent long-term.

Verdict: Fine for tiny sites; inefficient for what you’re doing here (membership/login/gating + AI overlay on C+B, curated taxonomy + brands system on Lillier).

Option 2: Try to force a “single codebase” across both platforms (true shared templates/components)
Pros

In theory, one source of truth.

Cons

In practice, Shopify themes (Liquid/JSON templates) and Squarespace 7.1 (sections/blocks + limited code injection) don’t share a common rendering model.

You’ll waste time building an adapter layer that’s more work than the project.

Verdict: Not worth it.

Option 3: The best approach: shared “DNA kit” + platform adapters
Build a Shared DNA Kit once:

design tokens (type scale, spacing scale, radii, shadows, button styles)

reusable section patterns (hero, editorial text block, card grids, CTA rows, accordions)

interaction patterns (modal behavior, nav patterns, form styling)

image rules (aspect ratios per module; crop guidance)

Then implement that kit in each platform using the platform’s native strengths:

Shopify: theme code (sections/snippets), collections, brand templates.

Squarespace 7.1: saved sections + page templates, minimal code injection, and only custom JS where required (ex: AI overlay).

Verdict: Highest leverage + lowest duplication + stays client-editable.

What we must give greatest attention now (because it drives everything)
1) Lock information architecture + navigation first
If the nav shifts later, you rebuild too much.

C+B top-level nav is explicitly defined (including persistent Login in header): Home, About, Work With Amanda, Learn, Stories, Blind Dinners, Membership, Login. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Lillier top-level nav is explicitly constrained: Home, Shop, Brands, About. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


2) Membership/gating rules (C+B) must be treated as core infrastructure
This is not just “copy”; it affects page access, CTAs, and routing.

Core = $25/mo, Premium = $59/mo 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Login is access control only, no dashboard, minimal UI 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Post-login routing rules are specified 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


3) The AI overlay behavior (C+B) is a real engineering requirement
AI opens as an overlay/modal and returns user to same scroll position. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Even if the AI “brains” are later, the interaction pattern is Phase 1-critical.

4) Lillier taxonomy constraints (Shopify) must be baked in early
Shop categories are limited to Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet for Phase 1. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Brands are editorial, filterable by primary category, and each brand is represented by a curated SKU set.
Also, several tempting expansions are explicitly out of scope. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Step-by-step plan to build both sites efficiently
Phase A — Create the Shared DNA Kit (1–2 days)
This is your biggest multiplier.

Define tokens once

Type scale (H1/H2/H3/body/small), line heights, letter spacing

Spacing scale (ex: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64)

Button styles (primary/secondary/ghost), focus states

Card styles (borders, shadows, hover)

Form inputs (text fields, labels, errors)

Define 10–12 shared section patterns
Examples (choose based on both sites):

Editorial hero (headline/subhead/body + 1–2 CTAs)

“What this is” editorial block

Card grid (3-up desktop, 1-up mobile)

Featured story/spotlight block

Section header + list

CTA strip

Accordion FAQ

Two-column editorial (collapses well on mobile)

“Brand spotlight” pattern (works for Shopify Brands and C+B Stories)

Create a “Style Guide” page spec
One page that includes every component/section so you can QA styling in one place.

Deliverable: a simple “DNA spec” doc + a CSS token sheet you can replicate into both platforms.

Phase B — Build platform foundations in parallel (2–4 days)
B1) Squarespace 7.1 foundation (C+B)
Use Squarespace for what it’s best at: client-editable sections.

Duplicate site to staging

Implement nav exactly as specified 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Build each page with saved sections that map to your shared section patterns:

Home (hero, what-this-is, AI teaser block, learn/work/dinners blocks, membership CTA) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


About, Work With Amanda, Learn, Stories, Blind Dinners, Membership, Login (all defined in the doc) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Custom code only where necessary:

global CSS injection for tokens + a few base classes

AI overlay JS (modal open/close, scroll lock, restore scroll) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


B2) Shopify foundation (Lillier)
Use Shopify for what it’s best at: structured catalog + reusable theme sections/snippets.

Start from a clean theme baseline (Dawn is fine) then build:

Header nav: Home / Shop / Brands / About only 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Collections: create primary category collections for Home/Beauty/Pantry/Pet 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Subcategories implemented as collections and/or filters (not nav) 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Brands: decide on data model early (metaobjects recommended) so brand pages can show story + selected SKUs 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Out-of-scope guardrails in the build:
Do not create nav items or IA for Journal/Gifts top-level/etc. 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Phase C — Build reusable components once per platform (but from the same pattern library) (1–2 weeks)
This is where you “avoid double work” in practice: you’re not copying code, you’re copying decisions.

C1) Shopify: sections/snippets as the reusable library
Implement your shared patterns as Shopify sections (hero, card grid, spotlight, CTA strip)

Use snippets for buttons/cards so styles don’t drift

Build templates:

Home page template (sections)

Collection template (shared filters + editorial header)

Brand page template (brand story + products)

C2) Squarespace: saved sections + page templates
Build the same patterns as saved sections

Use consistent naming for editor reuse (“DNA – Editorial Hero”, “DNA – CTA Strip”, etc.)

Create a short “Editor Guide” so Amanda can add pages without breaking the look

Phase D — Membership + gating + “AI overlay” (C+B) (built early, tested often)
Because C+B has the trickiest behavior, treat it as the technical critical path.

Create Core/Premium membership products with the given prices 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Apply gating rules to specific resources/stories (once the gated list is finalized)

Implement login page with minimal copy/fields per spec 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Confirm routing behavior (return-to-gated; otherwise home) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Implement AI overlay behavior per UX spec 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Phase E — Content + merchandising pass (ongoing, but scheduled)
C+B: paste copy into the structure, swap placeholder imagery with consistent aspect ratios

Lillier: create collections, assign products, ensure each brand has curated SKUs (not full catalog) 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Phase F — QA checklist and launch readiness (final week)
Do this once and apply to both sites:

Mobile-first QA: nav, spacing, tap targets, performance

Form QA: login, membership purchase flow

Gating QA: public vs member vs premium

Shopify catalog QA: collections, filters, brand pages

Link integrity QA across both

The “economic” sequencing I’d choose
If you want the smartest order (least rework):

Lock nav/IA for both sites (already mostly done in these docs) 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Build the Shared DNA Kit (tokens + patterns)

Implement the Shopify taxonomy + Brands model early (data structure first) 
Lillier Phase 1 Website Taxonomy


Implement C+B membership/login rules early (highest risk) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Then fill pages/sections rapidly using the shared pattern library

That sequence minimizes “redo” loops.

If you want, I can turn this into a concrete 4–5 week build calendar (week-by-week deliverables) aligned to your 30/40/30 milestones, using the nav/taxonomy constraints from both docs as the backbone.

I need an extensive plan full of action items after you conclude your comprehensive planning operations for this project. Take an abundance of time, as needed, to think things through, and think step by step. Thanks.
ChatGPT said:
To provide the most efficient, detailed, and realistic action plan for building both the Lillier (Shopify) and Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace) sites, could you please clarify the following:

Do you plan to manage the Shopify product catalog manually during Phase 1, or are you hoping to implement any import tools (e.g., CSV bulk upload, product feed connectors) from the start?

For Cupcakes + Broccoli’s membership system, do you have a preferred third-party plugin (like MemberSpace or Memberspace-compatible tools), or are you open to recommendations for gating and checkout?

Do you anticipate the Squarespace site needing any custom code injections (e.g., for design flexibility, interactivity, or animation), or are you aiming to stay within the no-code ecosystem?

Is the visual design system expected from the design partners still in progress, or have any core templates or components been delivered yet?

Do you expect your role post-launch to include site training/documentation handoff, or just ongoing maintenance and iteration?

These details will help define build priorities, plugin/tool evaluation, content loading order, and QA scheduling.

1. Whatever is easiest for me as the programmer who prefers to keep the code flexible, and whatever is simultaneously easy for the client (non-technical) to manage and extend later. So it needs some tech input for me to make things work technically, without getting bogged down in visual drag and drop shit - but it also needs to be not too technical from some angle that the client can manage it later.

2. Open.

3. Same situation as item 1. Keep things code from scratch friendly for me, the programmer. But we need to have discrete chunks of custom coded objects that the client can later easily reuse and edit in the user interface. Does that make sense? We discussed all this earlier in our conversation, you know, above.

4. Visual design system drafting is up to us for now, based on what we know from the docs and correspondence provided in our conversation here, and above.

5. Both.

Development Plan for Cupcakes+Broccoli (Squarespace 7.1) & Lillier (Shopify)
Introduction and Goals
We are building two complementary websites – Cupcakes + Broccoli (an educational community site on Squarespace 7.1) and Lillier (an e-commerce marketplace on Shopify). Both sites will share a unified visual design system and brand feel, while leveraging each platform’s strengths. The primary goals are to deliver mobile-first experiences with clear structure, built for easy owner editing and extension. Development will prioritize code-centric workflows for flexibility and scalability, avoiding over-reliance on drag-and-drop, while still enabling a non-technical client to manage content and reuse components via the UI after launch. All pages and features in Phase 1 will be built with an eye toward long-term maintainability, allowing new content and sections to be added without structural overhaul. Key Objectives:
Shared Design DNA: Implement the design partners’ component and style specifications on both sites, ensuring consistent typography, color palettes, and UI components across platforms. Both sites should have a cohesive look (layout, buttons, forms, etc.) so users sense a unified brand experience.
Flexible, Code-Based Development: Use developer-friendly workflows – custom code, templating, version control – to speed up development and avoid the constraints of purely visual editors. However, ensure that all site content (text, images, links) is managed through CMS features (Squarespace’s editor and Shopify’s theme/panels) rather than hardcoded in code, so the client can easily edit without touching code.
Reusable & Editable Components: Build pages from modular sections/blocks that can be reused and adjusted. For Squarespace, utilize 7.1’s Saved Sections feature to create a library of branded sections that can be dropped into any page
. For Shopify, leverage Online Store 2.0’s sections and blocks – self-contained components with customizable settings – to allow drag-and-drop page updates
. This will let the client extend pages or create new ones by mixing existing sections (e.g. hero banners, CTAs, product grids) without custom code.
Client-Friendly CMS Structure: Structure content types and editing workflows so a non-technical editor can safely update the site. This means using the built-in CMS capabilities of each platform (pages, collections, blogs, etc.) rather than custom code for content. We will avoid “hardcoding” copy or images into templates. Instead, use dynamic fields or editable areas:
In Squarespace, all text and images will be in editable content blocks or page settings (not in Code Injection except when absolutely necessary for design).
In Shopify, use theme schema settings and content entries so that, for example, homepage text, banner images, or product details come from theme editor inputs, collection descriptions, or pages – not fixed in Liquid templates. This ensures the client can change labels, imagery, and links through Shopify’s interface.
Balance Phase 1 and Future Needs: Deliver the required Phase 1 pages and functionality on time, but build the foundation to accommodate future growth. That means:
Using scalable architecture (e.g. setting up navigation, category structures, and membership logic that can handle new pages or features later without refactoring).
Possibly including placeholders or initial support for Phase 2 features (for instance, structuring the Shopify theme so adding a “Fashion” or “Gifts” category later is straightforward, even though these are out-of-scope in Phase 1).
Documenting and organizing code and assets clearly, so future developers (or the client, with guidance) can extend the sites.
With these goals in mind, below is a detailed breakdown comparing the development approach on Squarespace vs Shopify, followed by strategies specific to each site, and finally an implementation sequence with an actionable Phase 1 checklist.
Platform Workflow & Architecture Comparison: Squarespace 7.1 vs Shopify
Building on Squarespace 7.1 and Shopify will require different approaches, given the platforms’ inherent differences. We will leverage each platform in the way that best aligns with our goals of flexibility and client-friendly editing:
Squarespace 7.1 (Cupcakes + Broccoli)
Dev Workflow: Squarespace 7.1 does not support the old Developer Mode for full template code access (unlike Squarespace 7.0) – we cannot build from scratch by uploading templates
. Instead, development occurs within Squarespace’s framework:
We will use the Squarespace 7.1 section editor to assemble pages from pre-built sections and content blocks. Squarespace pages are composed of sections that stack vertically, each containing content blocks (text, images, buttons, etc.). We will choose section layouts that closely match the design, then fine-tune styling.
For custom styling or functionality beyond Squarespace’s style settings, we will add Custom CSS/JS via the Squarespace Code Injection feature (available on Business plan and above). Note: We’ll use custom code cautiously – while it gives flexibility, Squarespace warns that code injections can conflict with the platform’s own code and aren’t officially supported
. We’ll keep any injected code lean, test it thoroughly on different devices (to ensure it remains responsive and doesn’t break Squarespace’s mobile optimizations
), and document it for future maintenance.
Reusable Sections: A major Squarespace advantage for our needs is the Saved Sections feature (Squarespace 7.1) which lets us save a designed section and reuse it on other pages
. We will create a library of common sections (e.g. a newsletter signup block, a testimonial or quote block, a CTA banner) per the design system. This approach essentially builds a mini design system within Squarespace – the saved sections act as “branded building blocks” that ensure consistency and save time when creating new pages
. The client can add a saved section to any page with a couple of clicks instead of recreating layouts each time.
Content Management: All textual content and images will be managed through Squarespace’s CMS interface:
Static pages (About, Work With Amanda, Blind Dinners, etc.) will have their copy placed in text blocks that the client can edit inline.
Repeated content (like list of stories, or resources) will use Squarespace collections if applicable. For example, the “Stories” section can be a Blog page, so each story is a blog post – allowing Amanda to easily publish new stories through Squarespace’s blog editor. We will style the blog list and posts template to match the site design.
We will avoid any situation where the client would need to edit the site by touching code. (If a design element truly requires custom code to implement, we’ll try to wrap it in a user-friendly way – e.g. using Code Block with instructions, or at least isolating CSS that might need editing).
Design & Templating Constraints: Because we can’t fully code new page templates in 7.1, we will choose the base theme or initial layout that is closest to our needs and customize from there. Squarespace’s built-in style editor will be used for global styles (fonts, colors, spacing) as much as possible. We anticipate using custom CSS for fine-grain control (for example, if we need to perfectly match the design spec’s spacing or if certain elements like buttons need custom state styling beyond the style editor capabilities).
Membership Integration: Squarespace offers Member Areas (now referred to as “Member Sites”) as a way to gate content behind a sign-up/paywall
. We will utilize this for Cupcakes+Broccoli’s membership features. In practice, we’ll create a Member Area within the Squarespace site, which will contain pages only accessible to members (and choose free vs paid access as needed). Out-of-the-box, Squarespace will handle account creation, login, and paywalling of those pages – a user who isn’t logged in will see a sign-up prompt for the membership plan. We will configure at least two membership tiers:
A free tier (or public access) for basic content.
A premium paid tier for full content (as hinted by the copy: “Premium members receive unlimited access to deeper responses…” etc. and a CTA to compare membership options).
Using Squarespace’s system ensures only members with the appropriate plan can view protected pages
. This satisfies the requirement for “light membership / gated content for agreed pages/resources”. We will design the member pages to look like part of the site (avoiding a generic “dashboard” feel – e.g., by using the same header and styles on member pages).
Login/Signup UI: We will include a persistent Login button in the header (as noted in the nav spec) that triggers the Squarespace login overlay or directs to the login page. After login, members should seamlessly access the content; we’ll test that the transition doesn’t feel like leaving the site’s aesthetic.
Scalability & Maintenance: Since our ability to extend via code is limited, we will rely on Squarespace’s structured approach for scalability. For example, if new pages are needed, the client can duplicate an existing page (or insert saved sections) to preserve style consistency. Squarespace 7.1 allows duplicating entire pages and sections easily
. We will provide guidance on this to the client post-launch. The overall structure (navigation, page hierarchy) can be managed via the Squarespace Pages panel, which the client can handle for adding a new top-level page or rearranging navigation.
Risks/Bottlenecks (Squarespace): The main risk is hitting a wall with Squarespace’s limitations. If the design calls for a highly custom layout or interactive component not supported by Squarespace blocks, implementing it may require creative workarounds (custom code injection or embedding external widgets). We must also be mindful that custom code is not guaranteed to be future-proof on Squarespace
 – Squarespace updates could potentially break unsupported customizations. To mitigate this:
We will keep custom JavaScript/CSS modular and avoid affecting core features. For example, the AI Concierge overlay on the C+B homepage will likely be implemented via a custom code block or third-party script. We’ll implement it such that it loads separately (e.g., an embedded script or iframe for the AI chatbot) to avoid interfering with site content. We will ensure closing the AI modal returns the user to the same scroll position (per spec).
If any design element truly cannot be achieved within Squarespace’s framework, we will communicate with the design team to find an acceptable alternative that stays within platform bounds.
Performance on Squarespace can degrade if too many large images or heavy scripts are injected; we’ll optimize images (use Squarespace’s built-in responsive image features and provide appropriately sized images) and only load scripts when needed.
Shopify (Online Store 2.0) – Lillier
Dev Workflow: Shopify provides a full-featured development environment for themes, which aligns well with our code-based workflow preference. We will likely start with Shopify’s reference theme (e.g. Dawn, which is a lean, Shopify 2.0-compliant theme) as a base, and then build out the custom Lillier theme from there. Key workflow elements:
Use the Shopify CLI and Theme Kit/GitHub integration to develop locally with version control. This allows efficient coding in a local editor and syncing changes to a development theme on the Shopify store. It also provides a safety net (we can roll back if needed)
. We will have a Git repository for the theme code to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
Theme Architecture (Online Store 2.0): Shopify’s Online Store 2.0 introduced JSON-based templates and “sections everywhere,” enabling a modular, flexible theme structure
. We will utilize this fully:
Each page template (homepage, product page, collection page, etc.) will include sections that can be rearranged or customized via the Shopify Theme Editor. Sections and blocks are modular components that give merchants (the client) the opportunity to customize and extend their theme*
.* We will design most of Lillier’s content areas as sections (with configurable settings) so the client can easily modify content or layout without code.
For example, the homepage will consist of multiple custom sections: Hero banner, Category grid, Brand spotlight, “Lillier Difference” features, and a CTA/footer section. The client can reorder or toggle these sections in the theme editor, or even reuse them on other pages if needed.
We will create Liquid snippets for any repetitive code fragments (like a product card design used in multiple sections) to keep code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and maintainable.
Reusable & Extensible Components: Because Shopify doesn’t have an exact analog of Squarespace’s Saved Sections (Shopify sections themselves are inherently reusable in templates), we’ll ensure each custom section is built to be flexible:
Sections will use schema definitions to expose settings like text fields, image pickers, selectors, etc., so the client can change content easily. For instance, a “Category Highlights” section might have a setting for selecting which collections to feature and text to display. The schema also allows default content presets, so when we add the section it comes pre-configured with sample content that the client can then edit.
We will design these sections to be generalized enough for reuse. If a section might be useful on multiple pages (e.g., a generic two-column text + image section), we’ll code it in a way that it can be added anywhere via the theme editor. Shopify 2.0 sections can indeed be included on any page type, and merchants can add/remove sections per page as needed
.
Content Management (Shopify CMS): Shopify is primarily e-commerce, but it also includes a rudimentary CMS (Pages, Blog, and now Metaobjects). We plan to use:
Collections for organizing products, which doubles as our category pages. Per the Lillier taxonomy, we will set up top-level collections for each primary category (Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet). Products will be tagged or otherwise assigned so that each product belongs to one primary category (curation is intentional; each brand’s products mostly fall under one category).
Subcategories: We will implement subcategories as either additional collections or as product tags/metafields used for filtering, not as separate navigation entries. For example, within the “Home” category, subcategories like Kitchen, Bath, Cleaning, Living, etc. will be filters on the Home collection page rather than distinct pages. Shopify’s built-in filtering (OS 2.0) can filter a collection by product tags or metafields. We will configure filters (e.g. a filter by “Subcategory”) so that on a category page, a user can narrow products to a subcategory like “Kitchen” or “Bath”. This aligns with the requirement that subcategories remain in the background for Phase 1 (enhancing browsing but not cluttering the main nav).
Brands: We need to present brands in a dedicated section of the site (in nav and pages). To implement “Brands”:
We will likely create a collection (or page) for each Brand. One approach: treat each brand as a Shopify Collection, where collection title = brand name, collection description = brand story/description, and collection image = brand hero image. We can manually assign each brand’s products to its collection (or use an automated rule like “Product Vendor = BrandName”). This way, each brand has a “page” (the collection page) listing only that brand’s Phase 1 products, and we can render the brand story at top. We will style these brand pages to feel editorial (rich story content) rather than a plain product catalog.
The Brands index page (accessed via the “Brands” top nav) will list all brands. We will build a custom page template for this, possibly with a section that automatically pulls in all brand collections to display their logo or name with a link. (If using the collection approach, we can get a list of all Brand collections by using a common tag or by listing all collections in a certain manual menu). Alternatively, we might use Shopify’s new Metaobjects to create a structured list of brands (with fields for name, description, logo) and use an iteration in Liquid to output them. But for Phase 1, a simpler manual approach (hardcoding the list or using collections) is acceptable given a known list of brands, and it will still be easy for a developer to add a new brand entry when needed.
We will include filtering on brand pages by primary category if feasible. For example, on a brand page that has products from multiple categories, we could allow filtering the products list by those categories. However, since each brand is assigned one primary category in Phase 1, this filter may not be very relevant initially (most brands’ products all fall under the same category). We will plan the page structure such that if in future a brand spans categories, adding a filter or indicator (e.g. grouping products by category) is possible.
Pages & Blog: Other static content like the About page will be a Page in Shopify (allowing the client to edit content via a rich text editor). The About page can still use a custom Liquid template or sections for layout (for example, to insert a full-width image or custom design elements), but the main narrative text will be in the Page content for easy editing. We will similarly handle any other informational pages.
Editorial content / blog: The taxonomy explicitly puts editorial “Stories” out of scope for Phase 1. So initially, Lillier will not have a blog section. However, the homepage’s “Brand Spotlight” and “Explore More Stories” hint at a storytelling component. In Phase 1, we will fulfill this by perhaps linking “Explore More Stories” to the Brands page or a static page highlighting that this feature is coming. We’ll note this as a future enhancement (perhaps Phase 2 might introduce a blog or journal where monthly brand stories are posted). Our Phase 1 theme will be built to allow adding a blog later without major rework (Shopify has a built-in Blog feature).
Global Elements & Settings: We will utilize Shopify’s Theme Settings (in config/settings_schema.json) to centralize global style options and reusable content:
E.g., define color scheme variables, font choices (if custom fonts are needed, we’ll include them via CSS @font-face or use Shopify’s Google Fonts integration).
Set up a global announcement bar text (the copy “Shop Black. Every day. All in one cart.” can be a configurable text in the theme settings so the client can update it).
Enable customer accounts (optional at checkout) to allow returning customers, though no special member content on Lillier – it’s standard e-commerce accounts.
We’ll incorporate the provided utility texts: Cart helper text (“You can shop multiple Black-owned businesses with one checkout”) and Shipping note (“Items may ship separately from each brand”). These will be placed appropriately – e.g., on the Cart page or mini-cart UI, we’ll display those notes. We can implement these as static text or preferably editable text in theme settings so the client can tweak wording if needed in the future.
E-Commerce Setup: Beyond theme code, some configuration is needed:
We will configure shipping such that if products ship from different vendors, the order can still be placed in one checkout. Likely, we will set up a single location for inventory for simplicity (if Lillier acts as the merchant of record for all sales). We’ll use the note in the UI to explain that items may ship separately. (If down the line each brand ships directly, we might use Shopify’s multi-origin shipping feature – but that may complicate shipping rate calculations. For Phase 1, perhaps all items ship at a flat rate or free shipping threshold and then Lillier coordinates with brands manually.)
Set up tax, payment gateway, etc., but these are more operational and likely handled by the Lillier team; still, we must verify that our theme properly surfaces any necessary messaging (like showing tax inclusive/exclusive info, etc., if needed).
Collections and product organization will be carefully curated because it’s a curated marketplace with limited SKUs per brand. We’ll implement those collections and tag products accordingly, and ensure that the theme’s product listing components can handle small numbers elegantly (e.g., not assume infinite scroll or huge catalogs).
Scalability & Future-Proofing (Shopify): The Shopify site is being built with growth in mind:
Our category/collection structure can accommodate new categories (e.g., adding “Fashion” or “Gifts” later). We will avoid hardcoding category names in multiple places. Instead, use data-driven approaches where possible. For example, the homepage “Shop by Category” section can pull categories from a manual list or navigation, which we can update via Shopify admin when new ones are added, rather than requiring code changes.
Similarly, if more brands are onboarded, adding a new brand collection and including it in the Brands page should be a straightforward content update. We might document the steps for the client: “To add a brand: create a collection, tag products, add it to Brands page (via x method)”.
Because we are using Online Store 2.0, the theme can be updated in sections, and new sections can be added later by development without rebuilding the whole theme. We will keep the code organized and commented, making future edits or new features (like adding an editorial blog or gift cards page) easier.
We will follow Shopify’s best practices for theme development (ensuring accessibility, performance, and using Shopify’s built-in features rather than reinventing the wheel). For instance, we’ll use the Shopify Polaris icons or SVGs for consistency in UI (like cart, menu icons) and ensure text is accessible.
Risks/Bottlenecks (Shopify): Building a custom Shopify theme is time-intensive. Potential bottlenecks and our mitigation:
Complex Filtering or Features: If advanced filtering or a custom functionality (like product bundling or subscriptions) was needed, we might rely on Shopify apps. In Phase 1, it appears we can manage with native features (standard filtering, etc.), avoiding third-party app dependencies that could bloat the site. We’ll confirm if any app is required for things like email capture popups or reviews – if yes, integrate them carefully and ensure they don’t conflict with our code.
Data volume and performance: A marketplace could eventually have many products. In Phase 1, SKU counts are limited, so performance will be fine. But we’ll still code for efficiency: use lazy loading for images, limit liquid loops on front-end if product count grows, and test for any sluggishness.
Coordination with Design: If the design partners have very specific interactive elements (e.g., animations or complex hover effects), implementing those in Shopify might require additional libraries or scripts. We’ll weigh the value of each fancy effect vs. added complexity. Simpler is better for maintainability, especially with a client who will be managing content – we don’t want a fragile theme. We’ll highlight any such elements early and decide if they’re must-have or can be simplified.
Shopify-specific constraints: Certain layout decisions might be constrained by Shopify’s structure. For example, the checkout page on Shopify cannot be fully customized (only light branding) because it’s controlled by Shopify. That’s fine for us; we just ensure the logo and color scheme carry into checkout for consistency.
Timeline management: To avoid rushing at the end, we plan to develop the Shopify site in parallel with content integration. We will use placeholder content to build out the theme, then swap in final copy and images once ready. The risk is if final copy or imagery deviates significantly (size or length) from placeholders, it could require style adjustments. We will mitigate by using realistic sample data (e.g., create a few dummy products, use actual text from the copy docs during development where possible).
Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace 7.1) – Detailed Implementation Strategy
For Cupcakes+Broccoli (C+B), the focus is on content (educational resources, stories, community info) with a membership layer for premium content. We will implement a content-forward site with an emphasis on clarity and ease of reading, reflecting the platform’s mission. Below is the plan per aspect: Information Architecture & Page Structure: According to the project documents, C+B’s site map and pages include:
Home – Overview of the platform, key offerings, and CTAs into other sections.
About – Background on C+B and Amanda (founder’s story, mission).
Work With Amanda – Detailing consulting/advisory services (likely what the copy doc called “Services Page”).
Learn – The resource library overview (“Practical learning you can use” section, likely leading to resources).
Stories – A blog-like section for founder stories and experiences.
Blind Dinners – Info page about the invitation-based gatherings.
Membership – Explanation of membership options and benefits, with sign-up CTA.
Login – Not a page per se, but a link that triggers member login (provided by Squarespace’s system).
We will confirm the final page list in Phase 1 and ensure all those types are accounted for. The top navigation will mirror the above structure (with “Login” as a button). There may also be footer navigation for utility links (privacy policy, etc.), which we will add as needed. Homepage: The C+B homepage sets the tone. From copy provided:
Hero section with a powerful headline (“Black ownership is Black survival, freedom and wealth.”) and subhead, and primary CTA “Join Membership”. We will implement this as a bold hero section with text and a prominent call-to-action button. In Squarespace, we might use a built-in cover or banner section, or a combination of text blocks on a background. The CTA will link to the Membership page.
Secondary CTA “Learn More About C+B” goes to About page.
Next sections (“What This Is”, “Built Around Experience”) explain the platform’s approach. We’ll create a rich text section for these, possibly using a two-column layout (text and maybe an illustrative image if provided). Inline link “Learn how C+B works” will go to About page.
AI Concierge teaser: There’s a section describing the AI assistant and showing example questions. We plan to implement an interactive trigger (a button “Ask a question” that opens the AI interface as a modal overlay). The modal can be achieved with a Code Block injecting a custom script (possibly integrating something like an AI chat widget). The key is it should appear as an overlay on the homepage without navigating away. This may require custom HTML/JS – we’ll isolate it so it doesn’t conflict with other elements.
“Learn” teaser section on homepage with a CTA to Resources.
“Work With Amanda” teaser with CTA to that page.
“Blind Dinners” teaser with CTA.
“Membership” teaser with CTA(s) “Join Membership” and “Compare Options”.
Closing section with a resonant line (“Ownership is a practice”) and final membership CTA.
We will likely break the homepage into several sections matching the above content blocks. Using Squarespace’s section editor, we can create vertically stacked sections, each with appropriate background/color styling to differentiate. For example:
Hero: full-bleed background (maybe a color or image if provided) with centered text and buttons.
Content explanation sections: maybe a simple centered text section for “What This Is” and “Ask What You Are Stuck On” (AI) – possibly with an image or icon for the AI concierge to draw attention.
Teaser grid: We have a sequence of offerings (Learn, Work with Amanda, Blind Dinners, Membership). We might present these in individual sections or as a 2x2 grid of blocks with an image and text for each. Squarespace allows creating content layouts with multiple columns; if design calls for side-by-side teasers, we can either use a pre-made layout or build it via a Code Block with HTML/CSS for precise control.
Final CTA: a strong closing section with a background color that contrasts the top, repeating the membership invitation.
We will make each of these sections reusable where it makes sense. For instance, the closing “Explore Membership” CTA might also be useful to include at the end of other pages (About or Learn). We can save that section in Squarespace and insert it on multiple pages to ensure consistency
. Membership (Gated Content) Implementation: A critical part of C+B is the membership model:
We will enable Squarespace Member Areas and set up a member area (perhaps call it “Community” or “Members”). Within this Member Area, we will add any pages that should be gated. Based on content, likely gated content could include:
Certain resource library pages (perhaps premium tools or downloads).
Possibly the “Community” page (if it contains forum or community content for members).
“Premium members” perks like office hours info might be on a members-only page.
We’ll clarify with the client which pages/resources are for members only. For example, the Membership page itself (which describes options) would be public, but if there’s a “Member Home” or exclusive content library, that would be inside the member area.
Pricing Plans: Using Squarespace’s interface, we’ll create at least one paid membership plan (the Premium tier). If there is a free membership (e.g., for signing up to get limited access or just to collect emails), we can configure a $0 free plan as well. Squarespace allows multiple pricing plans per member area (free or recurring fee)
. The site’s Membership page will then have “Join” links that direct the user to purchase the appropriate plan.
We will style the paywall and login screens with the site’s branding. Squarespace lets you add a logo to the login page for member areas and some basic style adjustments. We will ensure that when a non-member hits a gated page, the experience of prompting them to sign up looks coherent (likely we’ll use the Membership page as the sales pitch and direct them from the paywall to that page to choose a plan).
Membership Page: This page will likely outline the benefits of membership and compare tiers. We’ll implement a section that can compare the Free vs Premium features (if needed, an anchor link to a comparison table within the page). Even if exact pricing or tier details are not in the copy docs, we will structure the page to accommodate two tiers and highlight the key difference (like premium gets unlimited AI, office hours, etc., while free is more limited content).
After purchase, members get access to the gated pages automatically (Squarespace manages that once pages are under the Member Area). We will test this flow thoroughly: sign up as a member, ensure we can log in/out, and see the correct content.
Other Key Pages:
About: Will describe the founder-led nature of C+B and what the platform is (content from the copy: “This is a founder-led practice...” and Amanda’s bio summary). We will format this with a combination of text and perhaps a photo of Amanda (if provided). The design might call for pull quotes or stylized text; we can do that with Squarespace’s text editor or small custom CSS for drop caps, etc. There’s an inline link “Learn how Membership works” that goes to Membership page. We ensure all such cross-links are set up.
Work With Amanda: This is a services page for consulting. The copy (from “Services Page” in docs) emphasizes execution, clear goals, etc.. We will lay this out likely with a hero section (“Support When We Need It” as headline) and then a textual description. If there are any specific service offerings or a call-to-action (like “Contact us to inquire about consulting”), we will include a contact form or button accordingly. (Squarespace has a Form Block we can use to capture inquiries.)
Learn (Resources) Page: The copy tagline is “Learn With Us – practical education designed to be used”. We suspect this page is an entry to the resource library, describing what kind of resources are available (tools, frameworks, etc.) and inviting users to explore. The CTA is “Explore Resources” which might lead either to a listing of resources or directly to membership sign-up if resources are gated. We need to clarify if the resources themselves are publicly listed. Possibly, the Learn page might list categories of resources (like Tools, Frameworks, Stories) but then trying to access might prompt login for some.
One approach: Use a Summary Block or a custom index page listing some resource items, so content can be easily updated. For example, if they have a category of resources (maybe a Blog named “Resources” or a Gallery of resources), we can auto-display latest entries. Given limited info, we’ll likely just build Learn as a static overview for Phase 1.
Stories: We will implement Stories as a blog on Squarespace. This allows the client to easily add new story entries over time, fulfilling the need for ongoing content.
We will set up a Blog Page titled “Stories” and use the provided content for the landing page hero (“Real Stories. Real Momentum.” and intro). The blog listing will show posts (title, excerpt, maybe an image if each story has one). We can tweak the layout via Squarespace’s blog settings or CSS to match the style (e.g., maybe a minimalist list or cards).
We will create a sample story post (or a few) using the provided example content about “decisions, uncertainty, momentum”, so that the section isn’t empty. The CTA “Start Reading” will simply scroll to or highlight the stories list below the hero.
If needed for design, we can use tag filters or categories within the blog to organize stories (not specified, but maybe in future they might categorize stories).
Blind Dinners: A static page describing what the Blind Dinners are (intimate gatherings for Black founders, not networking, with trust and shared understanding). We will format this clearly, possibly including imagery of such dinners if available. There might be an inquiry form if one can request an invite or sign up interest.
Login/Account: We will double-check the user flow for login. With Member Areas, Squarespace typically provides a login screen and a default “Account Management” page for members (where they can update their profile or payment method). We will ensure that link is accessible (maybe via the Login button or as a link in the footer “My Account” for logged-in users). The client (Amanda) should be able to manage members (Squarespace provides a list of members and their plans in the backend).
Design System on Squarespace: To maintain the visual consistency:
We’ll apply global style settings (fonts, colors) in the Squarespace Design panel. If the design spec calls for custom fonts not in Squarespace’s library, we can embed them via CSS. However, we try to use built-in font options for easier maintenance (Squarespace supports Google Fonts and some Adobe fonts).
We will define a consistent heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.) across the site, matching the design. For example, hero headlines might all be an H1 style – we ensure those are uniform (size, weight) on both home and other pages.
Buttons and links: style primary and secondary buttons according to the design system and use them consistently (e.g., the same “Join Membership” style button appears multiple times). We’ll set this in the style editor if possible so all Buttons blocks have that style.
Spacing and alignment: We’ll use CSS if needed to fine-tune margins/padding of sections to create a harmonious rhythm, so that when stacking saved sections we don’t get inconsistent spacing.
Testing on Squarespace: We will make sure to test the site on various devices (Squarespace’s responsive engine is generally good, but custom code like our AI modal or any custom HTML sections will need manual testing for responsiveness). We’ll also test the membership sign-up and login from a user perspective: e.g., what happens after sign-up (Squarespace can redirect to a certain page – we might have it redirect new members to a welcome page or the “Community” page). In summary, for Cupcakes+Broccoli we aim to deliver a content-rich site that the client can update like a blog/website, with minimal technical hurdles, and a smoothly integrated membership system for premium content access.
Lillier (Shopify) – Detailed Implementation Strategy
Lillier is a curated e-commerce marketplace, so our strategy centers on building a robust Shopify theme that supports an easy shopping experience across multiple categories and brands, while also conveying the brand’s story and mission (making it easy to “shop Black” daily). Navigation & Structure: From the taxonomy:
Main Menu: Home, Shop, Brands, About. (No other top-level items in Phase 1.)
The Shop menu will include the primary shopping categories (Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet) as sub-menu items. We will configure this in Shopify’s Navigation settings: a top-level “Shop” item that is either non-clickable or leads to a general “All Products” or “Shop” landing if needed, and four child links (Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet collections). The decision on whether “Shop” itself has a landing page: We might create a “Shop” collection list page that visually presents the categories (essentially duplicating what the homepage category section does). However, since the homepage already has “Shop by Category,” we might simply make “Shop” unclickable and rely on the dropdown. We’ll verify with the client which behavior is preferred for usability.
Brands menu leads to the brands index page listing all brand profiles.
About leads to the about page.
We’ll also include typical e-commerce utilities: a cart icon, and an account icon for login/register (Shopify can handle customer accounts).
Footer: We’ll set up a footer with links like Contact, FAQ (if any), Terms and Privacy, and social media links as needed. These can be configured via a separate footer menu for easy updating.
Homepage: The Lillier homepage content from the copy document:
Hero section: Headline “Own Your Joy”, subhead “Shop Black. Every day. All in one cart.”, and body text about Lillier being one-stop for high-quality products from Black-owned businesses. We will design a compelling hero, likely with a background image or graphic that evokes joy/ownership (if brand assets include a hero image). The CTAs in the hero: “Shop New Arrivals”, “Explore Brands”, and “Featured Collections”. These might be implemented as three prominent buttons or links. We can also consider using a slideshow if there are multiple hero images (not indicated, but we’ll stick to a static hero unless provided otherwise).
“Shop New Arrivals” will link to a collection of new products. We will create a “New Arrivals” automatic collection (e.g., tag products as “New” or use date added) and use that.
“Explore Brands” jumps to the Brands index.
“Featured Collections” – possibly scrolls down the homepage to the next section, which is “Shop by Category”, or it could link to a page listing all collections. The copy is a bit ambiguous; however, immediately after, the content lists categories with a headline “Shop by Category”. So it’s likely that by “Featured Collections” they mean those top categories.
Shop by Category section: Headline “Shop by Category”. The intro copy spans page 1-2 of the PDF and lists categories:
Household Essentials,
Beauty and Personal Care,
Food and Beverage,
Home and Décor,
Fashion and Accessories,
Gifts and Stationery.
This list includes 6 categories, which is more than the 4 primary categories for Phase 1. The taxonomy document explicitly says “Gifts” is out-of-scope for Phase 1 and doesn’t mention “Fashion” either. Possibly, the design copy was written in a forward-looking way. For Phase 1 delivery, we have two options:
Include all 6 categories on the homepage for completeness of the design system, even if some (Fashion, Gifts) initially have no products. They could link to placeholder collections or simply not be clickable. Or,
Limit the homepage categories to the 4 we know are launching (Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet) to avoid confusion, and adjust the copy if needed.
We will clarify with the team; but given “Household Essentials” sounds like “Home”, “Food & Beverage” = “Pantry”, etc., likely they intended these to map:
Household Essentials (could be subset of Home category),
Home & Décor (this also overlaps with Home),
Beauty & Personal Care (Beauty),
Food & Beverage (Pantry),
Fashion & Accessories (future),
Gifts & Stationery (future).
For Phase 1, we’ll implement the four main categories. We can present four or six cards on the homepage depending on final decision. Our code will be such that categories are data-driven. We could, for example, base this section on a manual list of collections defined in theme settings – so the client can add “Fashion” later easily by adding one more item to that list.
Each category card will have an image and category title. We will curate or design images for each (or use product images that represent the category). The category titles will link to the respective collection pages. Also, there is a CTA “Browse All Collections” at the end of that section. This might link to a page that shows all category collections (or all products). If we include all categories on the homepage, this might not be needed; but we could have it link to a “Shop” landing page listing the categories again in case someone skips down.
Brand Spotlight section: Headline “Behind Every Brand, a Story”. This section highlights that each month Lillier features a brand story. CTA “Explore More Stories” – since editorial is phase 2, for now this CTA can link to the Brands page (which is effectively stories about each brand). Or we might create a dedicated “Stories” page on Lillier that is an editorial blog placeholder, but given out-of-scope, better to point to Brands or About for now. Implementation: We could create a “Brand Spotlight” section in the theme that allows the client to feature one brand. For example, a section with:
An image or logo of the featured brand,
A short excerpt (the brand’s intro or current story teaser),
A link to read more (brand’s page).
They can update this monthly by selecting a different brand and updating text. We’ll build it to be easily editable (maybe drop-down of brand collections to choose one, if possible via a product or collection picker in the section settings, and a text area for the excerpt). If we can’t get dynamic data easily (Liquid can fetch a collection’s description), we might just have them fill in the fields manually.
The Lillier Difference section: Headline “More Than a Marketplace”. Body copy explains Lillier’s broader mission beyond checkout. It then lists supporting points:
One cart checkout across multiple brands,
Thousands of verified Black-owned businesses,
Everyday essentials alongside special finds,
Built for scale and sustainability.
We will design this section as a visually appealing list of unique selling points (USPs). Possibly use icons or simple graphics for each point (cart icon, checklist icon, etc.). We can style it as a grid of small highlights or as a column of bullet points with checkmarks. The text can be baked into the theme or made editable (since these points could evolve, making them editable is wise). CTA “Learn More About Lillier” will link to the About page for those who want a deeper explanation.
Closing Section: Headline “Every Cart Is a Contribution” and body copy about how every order helps a Black-owned business grow. CTA “Shop Now”. This is the inspirational closing that drives users to start shopping. We will implement this likely as a full-width banner or overlay text on an image (perhaps an image of joyful customers or entrepreneurs, if available). The “Shop Now” button will link to either the Shop page or simply scroll up to categories; but likely to the Shop (Home category or all products). Summarizing homepage sections:
Hero (Joy theme, CTAs)
Categories grid
Brand Spotlight
“Difference” mission highlights
Closing CTA
We will ensure the homepage is responsive: on mobile, grids will stack vertically (e.g., category cards stack 2 per row or single column, depending on design; text is readable without zoom). We will use CSS media queries or the inherent responsive design of Dawn as a base to adjust layouts.
Category (Collection) Pages: Each of the four main categories (Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet) will have a collection page template.
We’ll likely have a banner image and description at the top of each collection page to introduce the category (for SEO and UX). The taxonomy doc provides a “Purpose” and “Includes” for each category; we can incorporate some of that language into the collection description text. For example, the “Home” collection description might say it includes kitchen, bath, cleaning, decor items, etc., giving context. We can put that in the collection’s admin description and have the theme display it nicely.
Product Filtering: We will enable filters such as by subcategory (e.g., under Home, filter by Kitchen, Bath, Cleaning, etc.). Shopify 2.0 allows use of product tags or metafields as filter options. We could tag products with their subcategory (like a product in Home category might have tag “Kitchen” or “Bath”) and then set up filter by tag group. Alternatively, we create subcategory collections, but that adds complexity in navigation. Using filters is more elegant:
We’ll ensure each product has a metafield or tag for subcategory according to the taxonomy list etc.
In the theme’s collection template, we activate the filter sidebar (Shopify’s native filter, configured in admin to allow filtering by product tags or a custom metafield for subcategory).
We’ll test that filtering UX. If needed, we can use a third-party filter app, but likely unnecessary for the small scale.
The product grid on collection pages will show product cards with image, title, price, and perhaps the brand name (since that’s important in this context: maybe show “Brand X – Product Name”). We can customize the product card snippet to include vendor name.
If category pages need a certain sort (e.g., by default sort by featured, which the client can control manually by arranging products in collection), we ensure that’s set.
We will also consider pagination or infinite scroll. Given limited SKUs, we might not need pagination at launch, but we can leave the default pagination or a “Load more” button if provided by theme.
Brand Pages: As discussed, each brand will be a collection or page:
If using collections for brands:
We will create a separate collection template for brand collections so that it can display the brand story content nicely. For example, at the top of the page, show the brand’s logo or a banner, a text block for the story, then the product grid of that brand’s products.
The product grid on a brand page might not need filtering (since likely fewer products; but if a brand does have multiple categories, we could filter by category here as well – taxonomy suggests this is an option).
If we need more flexibility for design (like wanting to layout text and images in a richer way than a collection description allows), we could instead use a Page for brand profile and then embed a section that displays products (by a specific collection or dynamic by vendor). However, this would require making a unique page template per brand to know which products to pull – doable, but if number of brands is significant, that’s unwieldy. Using collections is simpler because Shopify automatically ties products to it.
We’ll ensure brand collection pages aren’t visible in main “Shop” filtering or others (they’ll mostly be accessed via Brands page or product links).
Brands Index page: We will create a Page (Brands) with a custom section that lists all brands with a link to each brand page. We might display brand logos or just names alphabetically. For Phase 1, the number of brands might be moderate, so a simple grid of logos with brand names is effective.
If the brand logos or images are not all ready or if visual consistency is an issue, we might list by name initially.
This page can also reiterate Lillier’s ethos, possibly with an intro paragraph (e.g., “Meet the brands” and a note that each brand is independently owned, etc.).
We’ll also consider SEO for brands: ensure each brand page has proper meta tags (Shopify will use collection name for title, etc., which is fine; we can further customize in the theme if needed).
Product Pages: Each product page will follow a template but we must adapt it to highlight the brand:
At the top, product title, price, variant options (if any), add-to-cart button – standard.
We will show the brand name (vendor) near the title or as a subtitle (e.g., “by [Brand Name]”). That brand name should link to the brand page so users can explore the brand’s story and other products.
Product media: images or videos. We’ll implement a gallery/carousel that is mobile-friendly (likely Dawn’s default gallery or a lightbox).
Product description: We have to write or insert whatever descriptions are given by the brands. Possibly, if there’s a consistent format (like listing ingredients for beauty, etc.), ensure styling.
We might also include a section on the product page template for “About the Brand” – a short blurb about the brand to reinforce the story, with a link to read more on the brand page. This can be done via the vendor info:
If brand info is short, we could utilize Shopify’s vendor field plus a static object: e.g., maintain a dictionary of vendor => short description in the theme, but that’s not client-editable.
Better, we could leverage Shopify’s Metafields: define a metafield on the Product or Vendor for “Brand short bio” and fill it for each. However, vendor metafields aren’t first-class in Shopify as of now (Shopify doesn’t have vendor-specific resource to attach metafield to each vendor easily). Alternatively, use a Metaobject (create a “Brand” metaobject with fields including name, bio, etc., link products to it via a metafield). This is advanced, and given phase 1 time, might be overkill. Instead, we can hardcode a solution for now: just ensure the brand pages carry that info, and the product page simply links to the brand page for full story.
So likely: product page shows “Brand: [Name]” as a link, and perhaps not duplicate the story.
Other sections on product page: We might include “Related products” or “More from [Brand]” to encourage browsing. Shopify can show more products from same collection or same vendor. We can include a “You may also like” section showing a few products either from the same category or brand.
We will ensure the product page template is sectioned as well, so we can easily add or remove elements (like if later we want to add reviews, we can drop in Shopify’s review app widget as a section).
About Page: The About content from the copy:
Headline “Own Your Joy” (same as homepage) – likely to use again for consistency.
Subhead “Making it easy to support Black-owned businesses every day.”.
Story text explaining why Lillier exists (problem statement of supporting Black businesses conveniently), how Lillier solves it, and the significance of every purchase.
A section “Why Lillier Exists” in the copy emphasizes the barriers Black-owned businesses face and Lillier’s solution.
“Our Name” story about the founder’s grandmother Lillier Madison and the philosophy of joy and ownership.
Closing line “Joy Is Something You Own” and CTA “Shop the Collection”.
We will break the About page into meaningful sections:
Possibly a hero banner with the headline and subhead.
A narrative section for “Our Story / Why Lillier Exists” – maybe an image of the founder or something alongside text describing the mission.
A smaller section for “Our Name” story, which adds a personal touch (we might style this as a pull-out quote or a distinct blockquote style to highlight the grandmother’s quote “You got to make your own self happy.”).
End with a CTA to shop (to drive users back to buying).
Since About is mostly static content, we can either hardcode it in the page template with the copy or, more flexibly, have it as a regular Page in Shopify with a rich text content that the client can edit. Perhaps we’ll use a hybrid: create the About page in admin and fill it with the main text, then use a custom about template that automatically inserts the “Our Name” callout and maybe an image in a predefined way for design consistency. Other Pages/Features:
Search: Shopify has a search page. We will style the search results page minimally (likely just ensure it uses our typography).
404 page: We should style the 404 to fit branding, possibly with a friendly message.
Account pages (login/register): Shopify allows some customization via language and some minor CSS. We will at least update the text to match tone (maybe a message on login like “Welcome back” or so). But this is minor.
Checkout: We can’t deeply customize checkout on basic Shopify, but we will upload the logo and set brand color for the checkout accents so it feels on-brand. Also include the shipping note again in checkout info if possible (Shopify allows adding a message on the cart or an info page before checkout; we could include “remember items ship separately” in the cart page as earlier).
Analytics and SEO: We will ensure that both sites have baseline SEO set:
For Squarespace, we’ll fill in SEO descriptions for each page (Squarespace has SEO settings per page) and connect Google Analytics (per the deliverables).
For Shopify, we’ll set up Google Analytics or Shopify’s analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc., as provided by the client. We’ll also generate sitemap, and ensure things like alt text on images are added. The theme will be coded with good HTML semantics (proper headings, etc.) for SEO.
Accessibility: We’ll follow accessibility best practices, especially on Shopify where we control code: alt text for images, proper aria labels for icons, keyboard navigability for menus, sufficient color contrast for text (we’ll verify the design colors against contrast guidelines and adjust if needed to be AA compliant).
Unified Brand Feel Across Sites: Finally, we will verify that when a user transitions from Cupcakes+Broccoli to Lillier (if that’s expected, since they are separate but related brands), the experience is consistent. Shared visual cues will include:
Color scheme: The same or complementary brand colors on both (e.g., if the primary color is a certain green or orange, both use it for buttons and links).
Typography: Using the same font families on both sites for headings and body, if licensing allows. If not, choose very similar styles.
Graphic elements: If the design uses certain shapes, iconography, or illustration styles, incorporate those on both.
Tone of content: Both sites’ copy already has a cohesive voice. We will ensure UI text (like button labels, error messages) align in tone (e.g., friendly and clear).
We might also cross-link the sites subtly: e.g., Lillier’s about page or footer might mention the connection to Cupcakes+Broccoli (if appropriate). Not a requirement, but something to consider if the brand wants a sense of ecosystem.
Before launch, we’ll do a final UI polish pass on both sites side by side to ensure things like the treatment of CTAs or form fields feel like part of the same family.
With the strategies defined for each site, we can now outline a build sequencing plan to implement Phase 1 efficiently, and provide an action-oriented checklist.
Build & Implementation Plan (Phased Sequence)
To execute this project efficiently, we will proceed in stages, some in parallel, to meet the target timeline (the outline mentioned a target around March 1 for Phase 1). Below is the sequencing plan with key milestones (M1–M4 from the outline) and tasks:
Milestone 1: Project Kickoff & Planning (M1) – Confirm all pages and requirements, gather assets.
Milestone 2: System & Core Templates implemented (M2) – Both sites have design system and main page structures in place (without final content).
Milestone 3: Content Insertion & Polish (M3) – All final copy and media placed, membership and products configured, sites nearly ready.
Milestone 4: QA, Launch Prep & Launch (M4) – Testing complete, revisions done, sites live.
We will utilize a staging approach: for Squarespace, we’ll likely build on the live site but not make the new pages public until launch (using “Not linked” section or a duplicate site if needed for safe staging). For Shopify, we will develop on an unpublished theme or development store, then publish at launch time.
Phase 1 Action Checklist
Below is an extensive, task-oriented checklist of actions for Phase 1, broken down by area:
Project Setup & Access
 Access Credentials: Obtain admin access to the existing Squarespace site (Cupcakes+Broccoli) and the Shopify account (Lillier). Ensure the Squarespace site is on a plan that supports Member Areas and custom code injection, and the Shopify store is on a plan that supports the needed features (likely Basic or higher for Shopify 2.0 and use of plugins if any).
 Local Dev Environment (Shopify): Install Shopify CLI and authenticate to the Lillier dev store. Pull down the base theme (e.g., Dawn) into a local repository. Set up Git for version control.
 Design Assets: Collect all design materials from design partners – style guide (colors, fonts), logos, icons, any UI kit or component specs, and image assets (photos for hero banners, product images from brands, etc.). If any asset is missing, mark a placeholder and request it.
 Content Confirmation: Gather final or near-final copy for both sites (the provided copy docs). Clarify any ambiguous navigation or category issues (e.g., confirm which categories to show on Lillier homepage, confirm if any C+B content is members-only beyond obvious cases). Make a final list of all pages to be built for each site.
 Kickoff Meeting: (If not already done) Meet with client/designers to walk through the plan, ensuring alignment on scope. Review any potential platform constraints (for example, ensure they understand Squarespace limitations and are okay with them). Confirm the membership offering details (free vs paid tiers, pricing, etc.) needed for C+B.
 Create Backup/Clone (Squarespace): Since we’ll be modifying an existing Squarespace site, create a backup or clone. If possible, enable Developer Mode in a test environment (though 7.1 doesn’t allow Developer Mode, as an alternative we can duplicate pages or spin up a trial site for experimentation). At minimum, export the site content or ensure we can revert changes if something goes awry.
Global Design System Implementation
 Squarespace Style Setup: In the Squarespace site’s Design panel, set the global fonts and colors according to the brand guide. Configure font families and sizes for each heading level and body text. Set site background and text colors, button styles (so all Buttons share the correct styling by default). If required, add custom CSS for any styles that aren’t configurable (e.g., if custom font via @font-face, load it in Code Injection with CSS, or if letter-spacing on headings needs to match exactly).
 Shopify Theme Base & Settings: In the theme code, define the color scheme and typography. Likely update theme.scss/CSS with brand colors, create variables. Add the brand font (if a Google Font, include via Shopify settings; if custom, add to assets and import in CSS). Configure settings_schema.json with theme settings for colors (primary, secondary, background, text, etc.) and typography scale if needed, so the client can tweak in editor if ever necessary.
 Shared Assets: Add logos to both sites. In Squarespace, upload the logo image and set it in the header. In Shopify, add logo in header section settings. Ensure retina versions if needed. Also, add any favicon or social sharing images to both.
 Verify Mobile Styles: Early on, test a sample page in both environments on a small screen to ensure fonts aren’t too large or colors have enough contrast. Adjust base sizes if needed for readability on mobile.
Structural Setup
 Squarespace Pages & Navigation: Create the page structure in Squarespace:
Home, About, Work With Amanda, Learn, Stories (Blog), Blind Dinners, Membership pages. Use the exact titles and order as per nav spec. Put them under Main Navigation in the correct order. Add the external “Login” link in the nav (Squarespace may allow a special login link if Member Areas is on; if not, we’ll use a URL like /member-login or whatever Squarespace uses for login).
For now, keep these new pages disabled or not linked (or behind an under-construction page) so the public doesn’t see them until launch. We might keep the current site intact and build new pages concurrently.
Set up the Stories as a Blog Page type. Configure the URL slug (e.g., /stories). Add a couple of example posts to populate it.
If any page (like “Work With Amanda”) should be a different type (maybe a Cover page?), decide and create accordingly. But likely all can be standard pages except Stories which is a blog.
 Squarespace Member Area: Enable Member Areas in Squarespace settings
. Create a new Member Area (via Pages panel, click “+” next to Member Areas)
. Name it appropriately (e.g., “Members” or “Community”). Choose a starter layout if prompted (we’ll likely end up customizing anyway). Under that Member Area section, create any pages that are specifically for members-only content (e.g., maybe a “Premium Resources” page, or “Office Hours Info” page, etc., based on what needs gating).
If all/most content is intended to be free except a few premium pages, we’ll only put those premium ones in the member area. For example, perhaps general “Learn” pages are public but actual resource downloads or premium AI access page is members only.
Configure pricing plans for the Member Area: Set up one free plan (if needed) and one paid plan (“Premium”), with details like price, billing interval (likely monthly or yearly), description of benefits. This also sets up the checkout for membership.
Copy the URL or slug for the login page that Squarespace provides (for linking our Login button).
 Shopify Collections & Products: In Shopify admin, create the collections for:
Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet (top categories). For each, add a description (using content from taxonomy for SEO/context) and a representative image if available.
If including “Fashion” and “Gifts” for future, we can create those collections now but maybe hide them from navigation until needed.
Create a “New Arrivals” collection (automatic, sort by created date or tag “New”).
Create brand collections for each brand that will be in Phase 1. Use brand name as title, add a short description or placeholder (will fill in later with actual brand story), and maybe a logo image if provided.
Add a handful of sample products to the store to begin theme development. At least one product per category and a couple per brand. Use placeholder images (or real ones if available early), a dummy price, assign to appropriate collections (both its category and its brand collection). Set the vendor field as the brand name (important for linking products to brand).
If any product has variants (like size or color), set up one example to test how the theme handles it.
We may not have all actual product data until later; but this step is critical so we can see product grids and design accordingly.
 Shopify Navigation: Go to Navigation in Shopify admin:
Main menu: Add “Home” (link to home page), “Shop” (we might add as an item that is just a placeholder or link to “all products” or first category), “Brands” (link to Brands page, which we’ll create as a Page), “About” (link to about page).
For “Shop” item, add submenu items: Home, Beauty, Pantry, Pet (each linking to the corresponding collection). If possible, make “Shop” itself unclickable by setting as # or just not linking anywhere (Shopify doesn’t allow empty link easily, but can use # for now).
Footer menu: Add standard links like FAQ (if we plan one), Contact, Terms, etc. Since not mentioned, perhaps at least add Privacy and Terms pages (we can generate boilerplate for those or leave placeholders).
 Brands Page (Shopify): Create a Page in Shopify called “Brands”. We will not put content in it yet; instead, we’ll assign a custom template to it later that will list the brands. But having it in place allows linking the nav.
Core Template Development
 Squarespace Homepage Layout: Start building the C+B homepage in Squarespace:
Insert a new page (if not already from template) for Home. Use section editor:
Add a section for Hero. Configure background (color or image), add heading, subheading, buttons as per content. Adjust style (font sizes, spacing) either in section settings or override with CSS if needed.
Add subsequent sections: “What This Is” (with headline and body text), “AI Concierge” (with example prompts). Possibly combine these two in one section with two columns or keep separate for each idea – depends on design. Use text blocks for copy and style inline elements like the example questions (maybe italic or bullet list).
Add “Learn” teaser section (headline + body + CTA button).
Add “Work With Amanda” teaser (similar structure).
Add “Blind Dinners” teaser.
Add “Membership” teaser (with two CTAs as given).
Add final “Closing” section (centered text and CTA).
For each section, use Squarespace’s options to match design (like background colors or images, padding, alignment). Where needed, save the section as a reusable one (e.g., the final CTA might be saved as “Closing CTA section” if we’ll reuse on other pages).
Insert any relevant images (if design has illustrations or photos in between text, use Image Blocks or background images in sections).
Do not publish any obviously incomplete content. If the homepage is replacing an existing one, we may keep it unlinked until launch and use a temporary homepage.
Keep notes of any limitations encountered (e.g., if cannot put two buttons side by side, perhaps use a button block and a text link as secondary, or custom HTML).
 Squarespace Other Pages: Build out structure for key pages:
About: Create a section with the main narrative (from copy). Possibly include an image of Amanda. Format the text nicely (maybe pull quotes for “They come for clarity.” line, etc., if in design).
Work With Amanda: Section with hero (headline from copy) and text. Possibly break into bullets or sub-sections if the content is long (the copy reads as a few paragraphs).
Learn: Section with hero (if any) and intro text. We might list resource categories or simply have a CTA to the resources library. If the plan is to eventually list resources, maybe include a summary block of latest “Stories” or some placeholder.
Blind Dinners: Section with descriptive text (maybe photo of a dinner table for ambience).
Membership: This page might have multiple sections: one to pitch overall membership value (similar to what’s on home), one to outline tier differences (perhaps a comparison table or a two-column list of Free vs Premium benefits). Use toggles or accordion if a lot of info per tier. Ensure there is a strong CTA here as well (Join now button which triggers membership signup).
Stories (Blog) List: Style the blog list. Choose between Squarespace’s summary block vs default blog page layout. We can use the blog page’s built-in layout options (grid or list, with or without images). Configure it to look clean. Possibly show the full text of latest story or just excerpts. Use the copy for Stories page intro as a guiding text at top.
Blog Post template: Ensure the styling for headings, body text, and images in a story is on-brand (we might set a custom style for the post title to use the same style as other page titles).
Note: For now, fill each page with the WIP copy. Actual final content might tweak but this gives us a base to test design and spacing.
 Squarespace Custom Code Elements: Implement any needed custom code:
Add Code Injection in header or footer for site-wide scripts: e.g., integrate Google Analytics tracking code (if account info provided).
Write a script for the AI Concierge modal:
Perhaps embed a third-party chat widget if one is chosen. If none exists yet, create a dummy modal (a hidden div with some text input and close button) just to demonstrate the flow. Use a Code Block on homepage to include a trigger button and a script that toggles the modal’s visibility. Ensure CSS covers full-screen overlay and proper z-index.
We’ll refine this when the actual AI backend is ready, but at least structure is in place.
Custom CSS: as we build pages, accumulate any extra CSS needed into the Custom CSS panel. Organize it by page or component (comment sections clearly, e.g., /* Homepage Hero styles */). For instance, if we need to adjust the spacing after each section or style the membership comparison table, do it here.
 Shopify Theme Coding: In parallel, start coding the Shopify theme structure:
Header: Edit the header section (sections/header.liquid). Implement the logo placement, navigation include (Shopify’s main-menu), and icons for cart/account. If a mega-menu or dropdown is needed for the Shop menu, implement dropdown markup (Dawn might have a ready approach for nested menus). Ensure “Brands” and “About” appear. Possibly include a favicon or small tagline in the header if design calls for it (not likely).
Footer: Edit sections/footer.liquid. Add necessary menus (Shopify often has menu schema for footer links). Include social icons if any. Include the tagline or a short about blurb if desired.
Homepage (index.json): Construct the JSON template with the sections:
Hero section: Create sections/hero-banner.liquid (or adapt Dawn’s existing hero if available). Add schema fields for heading, subheading, text, background image, and up to 3 CTA buttons (with link and label). We will bind these to the copy provided. For now, set default text as per the WIP content. Make sure it’s flexible (if they want to change headline later).
Category grid section: Create a custom sections/home-categories.liquid. This section will display a set of collections. In schema, we can use a collection list setting (Shopify allows repeating blocks in schema of type collection). For example, allow up to 6 collection blocks, each with an image (we can default to collection image) and title (collection title). If we want to override titles (like use “Household Essentials” instead of the collection’s actual name “Home”), we could allow custom text – but likely better to keep them in sync with collection names for consistency. For now, we use collection titles.
In the template, loop through the collection blocks and output an image box with the collection’s image and title, linking to the collection URL.
Default state: add the 4 main collections and potentially 2 future ones as disabled blocks or commented out.
Include the section heading “Shop by Category” and intro text from copy in the section’s static content or schema.
Put a configurable “Browse All Collections” link at bottom (schema text field for link label and a link selector).
Brand Spotlight section: sections/brand-spotlight.liquid. Schema: maybe allow selecting a specific Brand collection (or a specific product or metaobject if that’s easier – collection is fine if each brand is a collection). Also fields for spotlight title, description, and link text. Implementation: display the brand’s image or a featured product image, the provided text (or we could dynamically pull the collection’s description as the story snippet), and a link to that brand’s page.
We’ll set default to whatever brand is planned first (if known). If not, keep generic.
Lillier Difference section: sections/lillier-difference.liquid. This can be mostly static content from the copy since it’s describing the platform’s benefits. Schema fields: maybe just text for each bullet point in case they want to tweak phrasing. We can also code the points directly from copy to save time, but giving editability is nice. We’ll include the heading “More Than a Marketplace” and the bullet list (structured as nice icons or checkmarks). Possibly each point can be a schema list of text items (makes editing easier if they want to add or remove points in future).
Closing CTA section: Perhaps reuse a generic section or create sections/home-closing.liquid. Schema: heading text, body text, button link. Default values from copy (“Every Cart Is a Contribution” etc.).
Once these custom sections are created, include them in templates/index.json in the desired order with preset content. Shopify’s CLI might allow us to generate these easily. We will then open the theme editor preview to verify layout.
Collection Template: Create a templates/collection.json (Shopify 2.0 uses JSON for default). We’ll likely use one template for all top-level categories and a variant for brand collections if needed:
In collection.json, include the section main-collection-banner (we might code a section that shows the collection image and description nicely).
Include the default product-grid section (Dawn provides a section for the product grid and filtering). We might utilize that or write our own if customizing the grid. Possibly easier is to use Dawn’s main-collection-product-grid which comes with built-in filter and sort controls, then style via CSS as needed to match design. We’ll test that.
Save this as the default template for all collections.
If brand pages need a different layout (like story at top plus products), consider creating an alternate template collection.brand.json. That template could use a different section which prints the collection description in a bigger way (for brand story) and maybe hides filters (since filtering by category on a single brand could be a nice-to-have but not crucial day1).
Assign brand collections to the brand template if we do this.
Product Template: Edit templates/product.json. Use Dawn’s default sections (product info, product recommendations, etc.) as baseline:
Ensure the product page shows the vendor. In Dawn’s main-product.liquid, add the vendor name linked to the brand page (we can construct link to /collections/<vendor-handle> if using collections for brand, or /pages/<brand-page> if not).
Check Dawn’s section for product recommendation; it typically shows related items (from same collection). That might suffice for “You may also like”. If needed, adjust logic to show more from same brand or category.
Include a section or block for product description that splits into tabs if needed (some theme do that for long descriptions or additional info). Probably not needed unless product info is large.
Add a static note on product page if desired, like “Shipping: Items from this brand may ship separately.” But since that’s repeated for all, maybe skip to avoid clutter.
Brands Page Template: We will create a custom liquid template for the Brands index:
templates/page.brands.liquid (with corresponding page.brands.json if using JSON template). In it, we include a section (or just hardcode within the template) that iterates over all brand collections.
One approach: If all brand collections share a tag like “Brand” or are all in a manual “Brands” collection list, we can fetch those. Shopify’s Liquid can’t directly query all collections except by type of rules. Alternatively, we maintain a menu “Brands” with all brand links and iterate through that menu in Liquid to display each brand. Actually, using a menu might be simplest: We can ask the client to maintain the Brands list via Navigation. However, duplicating data (collections and menu) is not ideal but acceptable.
To keep it simple: We may use the all_products global to get vendor names (but that requires some trick and is not straightforward in Liquid loops).
Given time, we might hardcode a list for now and note to improve later. But since they likely won’t add brands frequently without a developer initially, a hardcoded list (or a list in the page content) is okay for Phase 1. We will however strongly prefer a dynamic solution:
Perhaps create a collection of collections via the custom list-collections.liquid that Dawn has for “all collections” and filter that by those that are brand collections. If we name all brand collections with a prefix like “Brand: X”, maybe we can filter by name. Or put them all under a smart collection category which isn’t possible in Shopify.
Possibly easiest: Use JavaScript to fetch collection listings via Shopify’s Storefront API or sections. But that’s too heavy.
For now, plan: manually code brand entries for each known brand in page.brands.liquid – each entry showing brand image, name, maybe one-liner, and link. Leave instructions that to add a new brand, one must edit this template (or we’ll update it as developer).
Alternatively, store brand info in a JSON file or metafield. But that requires code to parse if not integrated.
We’ll decide on the least brittle approach given the time.
About Page: Create templates/page.about.json or similar. We can use the theme editor to craft the about page with existing sections:
Possibly reuse the Hero section for a banner at top (“Own Your Joy” again).
Use a rich text section for the story content (Shopify has a section type for custom content or we can create one).
Use an image-with-text section to display the anecdote about Lillier Madison (maybe an image of her if available, with the quote text overlay or caption).
Conclude with a CTA section (perhaps reuse the closing CTA style urging “Shop the Collection”).
If easier, we might not need a custom template file; we can just use the default page template and configure sections via the theme editor for the About page, since in OS 2.0 each page can have its own section layout. That may be sufficient: open “About” in theme editor and build it from the sections we created (hero, text, etc.). This keeps content easily editable by merchant as well (text would be set in those sections or in the page’s content).
 Liquid & Schema QA: Go through each Liquid file and JSON to fix any syntax errors. Use theme check or similar tools. Then preview on a development theme:
Load the Shopify dev site preview. Check that homepage renders all sections correctly with our placeholder content. Tweak spacing, responsive behavior (shrink browser or use Chrome dev tools for mobile width).
Click through a category page: see products, test filters (enable filtering for that collection in admin by selecting filter options). Adjust filter styles if needed (Shopify might render a basic sidebar; ensure it fits brand – if needed, apply CSS to style checkboxes or dropdowns).
Open a product page: verify vendor link goes to brand collection and works. Check image gallery and add-to-cart. We’ll use Shopify’s preview without actual purchase since store likely password-protected until launch.
Check the Brands page: ensure all brand links work (point to brand collections). If any brand has no products yet, ensure page still loads (maybe hide if empty).
Check About page layout in preview, adjust if something is off.
Client-Side Features & Integrations
 Membership Purchase Flow Test (Squarespace): In Squarespace, do a dry run: click Join on Membership page, see the sign-up flow. (We might need to actually simulate a purchase – we can create a 100% discount code for ourselves if setting a paid plan, or set a $0 price for testing, because we may not want to actually charge a card in dev. Or use Squarespace’s member area preview mode if available). Check that after “purchase” we can access a member-only page. Check the email notification Squarespace sends to new members (so we can customize it if needed with branding).
 E-commerce Settings (Shopify): Configure basic shop settings:
Set up payment gateway in test mode (or at least enable Bogus gateway) to test checkout if needed.
Configure shipping rates (e.g., flat rate or free shipping threshold) just to simulate the flow. (We’ll eventually get final shipping setup from client).
Add shop policies (we can paste provided or placeholder text into Shopify’s legal settings so that the footer links to Terms/Privacy pages are populated).
If the client has any apps to install (for email marketing popup, reviews, etc.), integrate them now and ensure they don’t visually break the theme. For example, if using an email capture app, set it up and test that the popup shows and can be closed, etc.
 Analytics and SEO Integration:
Squarespace: Insert Google Analytics Tracking ID or Google Tag Manager snippet via Code Injection (if client provided). Enable built-in SEO settings like generating sitemap, setting site title format, etc. Fill page descriptions for SEO using the copy (maybe take first sentence of each page).
Shopify: Add Google Analytics UA or GA4 ID in preferences, Facebook Pixel if given. Check that theme has the {{ content_for_header }} in <head> and {{ content_for_footer }} before </body> – Dawn does – to ensure all tracking scripts (and app scripts) load. Set store meta title and meta description in Preferences. For each page/collection/product, make sure the SEO meta fields are filled reasonably (Shopify auto-generates from content, we can adjust important ones like homepage and about).
 Performance Considerations: Optimize any large images (ensure hero images are compressed, use correct dimensions). Shopify will auto generate different sizes for img URL, and Squarespace does similar, but we should still use appropriately sized images for banners. Remove any unused sections or code before launch to avoid bloat.
 Cross-Site Consistency Check: Compare elements on both sites:
Do buttons have the same shape and color? Adjust CSS if one is off.
Are headings in similar style and tone? E.g., if one site uses all-caps for H2, the other should too if that’s brand style.
Check that both have favicon set (perhaps the same favicon if they’re sister sites).
If any content overlaps (not much except maybe explaining mission), ensure wording is aligned or at least not contradictory.
Content Population & Review
 Import Final Copy: Once the client provides final edited copy (if the WIP docs update), replace any placeholder text on both sites with final text. This includes product descriptions for actual products on Lillier, the final list of bullet points or CTA texts if they changed, etc. Double-check for typos or inconsistencies during this process.
 Add Imagery: Upload final images:
For Squarespace: add any illustrations or photos on pages (e.g., maybe an image of Amanda on About, or decorative images on Home). Use high-quality but optimized images. Set appropriate focal points in Squarespace so responsive cropping looks good.
For Shopify: upload product photos for all launch products (client will need to provide these). Ensure each product has at least one good image, ideally more. Also upload brand logos or lifestyle images for brand pages if provided. Add them to the brand collections or wherever needed in theme (the Brand spotlight might have a specific image to use).
Hero banners: ensure we have a compelling hero image for Lillier (if they want one behind “Own Your Joy”). If none provided, we might choose a color background or a pattern to keep it clean.
 Configure Products (Final): Enter real product data in Shopify:
Add all products slated for launch, with proper titles, descriptions, pricing, SKU, stock, vendor, collections, tags for subcategories, etc. This might be done via CSV if many – the client might do it, but as developers, we might assist or at least spot-check one per category.
Ensure each product is assigned to exactly one of the main category collections (to enforce the taxonomy rule).
Set up collection sort orders or manually merchandise the category pages if required (e.g., maybe feature certain products at top).
 Membership Content (Squarespace): Fill in any gated content pages:
If there are premium resource articles or downloads ready, add them to the member area pages. For example, if “premium resources library” has some PDFs or templates, upload those and link them.
If office hours schedule is to be displayed for premium, put that info on the appropriate page.
Essentially, ensure that when a premium member logs in, there is actually valuable content to see, not just a blank page. We might create a welcome page for members: “Welcome, here’s how to get started” etc.
 Internal Linking: Go through both sites and link everything:
On C+B, ensure every CTA button or link points to the correct page or section (use anchor links for Membership page comparison section if needed).
On Lillier, link homepage CTAs to their targets (New Arrivals collection, etc.). Link any “Learn More” to About, “Explore Brands” to Brands page.
In any text where there’s a reference to another section (e.g., in About, “Every purchase is a vote for ownership” might not need a link, but if any text says “See our brands” make it a link).
Check that no link is broken (especially, if we changed any page slugs for readability, update nav and links accordingly).
 Client Review Session: Walk the client (and design partners) through the nearly finished sites:
Gather feedback on visual fidelity to design. Tweak styles if colors or spacing are slightly off.
If client finds editing something confusing in the CMS, adjust to simplify (for example, if editing a certain text requires digging into theme code, perhaps add a schema field to expose it).
Confirm the membership sign-up pricing and text are correct (maybe legal needs adding that it's recurring billing, etc.).
Incorporate any content changes they request (they might reword some section after seeing it live).
Ensure legal compliance: e.g., if there’s a membership, have Terms of Service accessible; if collecting emails, have a privacy policy linked.
Quality Assurance (QA) & Testing
 Cross-Browser Testing: View both sites on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Also test on iOS Safari and an Android Chrome. Check for any layout breaking or font issues. Fix any browser-specific problems (like flexbox issues or anything).
 Responsive Testing (Detailed): Use dev tools or devices to test at various breakpoints:
For C+B: ensure navigation collapses to a mobile menu nicely (Squarespace handles this automatically with its templates). Check that long headings or CTAs aren’t cut off on small screens. Verify the AI modal is usable on mobile (e.g., maybe it needs a full-screen overlay style on mobile).
For Lillier: test the homepage sections on mobile (category grid might turn into a swipe carousel or stack; ensure text remains readable). Test the collection filter on mobile – Shopify will likely show a “Filter” button that toggles a sidebar or dropdown; verify that works and is styled properly. Test the product page on mobile (image gallery swipe, add-to-cart usability).
If any sections look awkward on small screens, add responsive CSS rules to adjust (like maybe fewer columns, smaller text, hide certain decorative images on mobile, etc.).
 Performance Check: Run a Google Lighthouse audit or Shopify’s theme analyzer:
Aim for good scores on performance. If any large JS or image slows it down, consider lazy-loading it. For instance, ensure that any Youtube/Vimeo embeds (if any) are deferred or use a preview image.
For Shopify, check liquid rendering speed (if we used heavy loops, but with small product count it should be fine). Also consider enabling Shopify’s built-in image lazy loading (Dawn does that).
On Squarespace, not much we can do beyond optimizing images and not adding too many third-party scripts. The AI script might be one – ensure it loads when needed (maybe on clicking the button) rather than on page load if possible.
 Functional Testing:
Forms: Submit any contact or newsletter forms to ensure emails get sent or stored (Squarespace forms to email or storage, Shopify newsletter form to customer list).
Membership purchase: In Squarespace, do a final end-to-end test: create a test account, purchase membership (maybe with a 100% off code or a test gateway if available). Ensure the content unlocks. Then cancel that membership (to test if cancellation messaging is clear).
E-commerce flow: In Shopify, simulate a purchase:
Add a couple of products (from different brands) to cart. Verify cart page shows both, and the messaging like “multiple brands one checkout” is visible if we put it there.
Proceed to checkout (maybe use a test payment or just go to the payment screen and then abort if live gateway). Ensure shipping options show properly for multiple items, and any additional info (like “ships separately” could be reiterated on checkout page as static text if needed).
If possible, place an order in test mode to ensure order confirmation and emails work. Then check in admin that order split by location if multiple, etc. (If multi-origin shipping is configured, test that shipping rates appear correctly. If not using that, ensure just one shipping entry).
Search and Navigation: Use the search box to find a product or brand, see that results are reasonable. Click through the navigation links on both sites to ensure all go to the right place.
Account login (Shopify): Create a customer account via the storefront (if we enabled accounts optional). Log out, log in, see that nothing odd happens (the account area will be basic but at least it works).
Edge Cases: Try weird scenarios:
Very long product title or very long brand name – does it break layout? (We can truncate or CSS wrap as needed.)
No products in a category – does the page handle “No products” elegantly? We might add a message like “Coming soon” on empty collections.
Member tries to access without logging in – ensure the Squarespace paywall appears as expected.
Rapidly resizing screen or using an iPad – check if design still looks good on intermediate tablet sizes.
 Fix Bugs: For any issues found in testing, fix them. This could involve adjusting CSS, tweaking section schema, or even a quick script fix. Re-test those fixes.
 Content Proofreading: Read through all text on the live site with fresh eyes or have a colleague do it. Ensure formatting is correct (no weird line breaks, lists display properly, special characters show correctly, etc.). Check that capitalization is consistent (e.g., some headings in copy might be in Title Case, make sure style doesn’t accidentally uppercase everything unless intended).
Launch Preparation
 Squarespace Launch Prep: If we built new pages hidden, now is time to go live:
Double-check that the site’s domain is correctly connected and no “Under Construction” remains. (If we want to coordinate launch timing, Squarespace doesn’t have a staging push, so we might either manually swap homepage content at a low-traffic time or use a “Site Availability” password and then remove it at launch moment.)
Connect domain and SSL: ensure the custom domain (if different from squarespace.com placeholder) is set up with proper DNS, and SSL is on.
Remove any test content/users: e.g., remove our test member account (so it doesn’t count toward anything or appear in lists).
Ensure member area is set to “Active” and payment gateway for membership (Squarespace will use Stripe likely) is configured if needed for the paid tier.
Finalize any SEO/social settings: set the social share image for homepage etc., so when the site is shared it looks nice.
 Shopify Launch Prep:
Make sure the store status is switched from password-protected to public when ready. (Don’t forget to disable the storefront password on launch day so people can access the site.)
If the store was on a temporary domain (myshopify.com), set up the custom domain (e.g., lillier.com) in Shopify and switch primary domain, confirm it’s working.
Ensure all payment and tax settings are correctly input and go through a live transaction with a real card (perhaps a $1 product or a test item) to ensure payment flows to the correct account.
Uninstall or turn off any dev/test apps or code. E.g., remove the theme preview bar, disable “theme watching” from CLI.
Switch to the newly developed theme as the live theme. (We will have been previewing it; now we publish it.)
Quickly smoke-test the live theme after publish (just in case something behaves differently on live).
 Performance Monitoring Setup: Set up Google Analytics dashboards or Shopify’s analytics to monitor traffic and conversions. If any specific events (like membership sign-up, or completion of checkout) should be tracked, ensure those are firing. This might involve enabling Shopify’s conversion tracking or adding a code snippet to the order confirmation (which is possible in Shopify admin).
 Backup & Handoff: Download a backup of the final Shopify theme code and save it (and we already have it in Git). For Squarespace, export site content (Squarespace allows export of certain content like blog to XML – do that for records). These backups are for safety.
Prepare a short guide or training doc for the client, explaining how to:
Add a blog post (story) on C+B.
Edit a page on Squarespace (like updating text or adding a new section).
Add a new product or collection on Shopify, and how to ensure it appears (especially steps to categorize it and maybe add brand).
Fulfilling orders in Shopify (if they need basic training).
Add a new member-only page in Squarespace if they plan to add more content for members.
Also, how to use any special features we built, like updating the “Brand Spotlight” section on the homepage (we should document: go to Theme Editor > Brand Spotlight section > select a brand, update text, etc.).
Share this documentation with the client.
Post-Launch & Ongoing (Beyond Phase 1, but good to note)
 Monitor site in the first days for any user feedback or errors (e.g., watch for any 404s in Google Analytics, or customers encountering checkout issues).
 Be prepared for Phase 2 enhancements (like adding those editorial stories on Lillier or expanding membership features on C+B) by keeping the codebase and content organized. We will have a retrospective to note any improvements in workflow for the next phase.
Each of the above tasks will help ensure clarity, flexibility, and scalability of the two sites as promised. By the end of Phase 1, Cupcakes+Broccoli and Lillier will both be delivered with a cohesive design system, an efficient content management approach, and a structure that supports both immediate needs and future growth. This thorough approach mitigates risks and sets the client up for long-term success in managing their websites. Sources:

For squarespace 7.1 = how do we code custom sections that we can save as discrete chunks, to later be reused and edited within the UI visually? Alternatively, if this is NOT possible at all in 7.1, then how can we use a different version of squarespace where this is possible?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 3m 50s
The blunt truth about Squarespace 7.1 “custom sections”
In Squarespace 7.1, you cannot build a truly custom, code-defined “section type” that shows up in the editor with nice editable fields the way Shopify sections do. Squarespace supports client-side custom code via Code Blocks / Code Injection / Custom CSS, but that code does not become a first-class, reusable “component with visual controls.” 

What you can do (and what I recommend for this project): build a reusable Section Library using Saved Sections, where the layout + styling rules come from your global CSS/system and the content stays in normal Squarespace blocks so the client can edit visually. 

Best approach in Squarespace 7.1: “Saved Sections + System CSS + Client-editable blocks”
Why this matches your goals
You only do the “drag/drop” work once per section pattern, then reuse forever via Saved Sections.

The client edits copy/images/buttons in the normal UI, without touching code.

You still get a code-forward workflow because the “design system” lives in global CSS + light JS, not in endless per-page manual tweaks. 

Key constraint to design around
Saved Sections are snapshots. If you later improve the section template, it won’t automatically update every place it’s been used—you’d update instances manually (or re-insert). 

So: use Saved Sections for layout patterns, and use centralized content mechanisms (Collections/Summary blocks) for anything you’ll want to update globally.

Step-by-step: how to build “discrete chunks” that are reusable and UI-editable
1) Create a “Section Library” page (your internal component catalog)
Create a page in Not Linked called something like “Section Library”.

On that page, build your 10–15 core patterns (hero, editorial split, CTA, card grid, story list, etc.).

This page becomes your single source of truth for structure.

(“Not Linked” is perfect for internal build pages you don’t want in nav.) 

2) Build sections using native blocks as the editable surface
For each section pattern:

Use Text / Image / Button / Gallery blocks for everything the client should edit.

Avoid Code Blocks unless you truly need a micro-interaction that Squarespace can’t do.

This is the critical trick: content stays native, so client edits are painless.

3) Save each section as a Saved Section
Squarespace 7.1 supports saving a section to reuse elsewhere. 

After you’ve built a section, use the Save Section flow (the “heart/save” action in the section controls). 

Name them like a real component system:

C+B / Hero – Editorial

C+B / CTA – Join Community

C+B / Grid – 3 Cards

etc.

4) Create pages by assembling from your Saved Sections catalog
This is where you stop doing repetitive layout work:

New page = add page → insert saved sections → adjust copy/images.

For you, it becomes “composition,” not “designing.”

5) Put the “design system” in global styles, not per-section fiddling
Use:

Site Styles for global typography/colors

Custom CSS for tokens (spacing scale, button rules, card rules)

Code Injection only when you need behavior (tiny JS) 

This is how you stay “programmer-first” while still building in Squarespace.

Make it more reusable: give sections stable hooks (without brittle random IDs)
Squarespace sections have internal data-section-id values, but those are not friendly to maintain across reuse. A better option in 7.1 now is built-in section Anchor Links: you can assign an anchor slug per section in the editor. 

Practical use:

Assign slugs like cnb-hero-editorial, cnb-cta-join, etc.

You can then write CSS/JS that targets those anchors (how exactly it appears in DOM can vary, but the anchor mechanism is official and stable for linking). 

This gives you a repeatable “component naming” habit that doesn’t rely on hunting random IDs.

Where you shouldn’t use Saved Sections (and what to do instead)
Because Saved Sections don’t sync globally 
, anything that must update everywhere should be built using centralized content features, for example:

Stories as a blog/collection feed + a Summary block on the Home page

Any “Featured” grids that should auto-populate from a collection

This is how you avoid updating the same content in 6 places.

If you insist on “real coded components with editor controls”: the 7.0/Developer Platform reality
Squarespace’s Developer Platform (template-level code access) is Version 7.0 only. 

But:

You cannot downgrade an existing 7.1 site to 7.0. 

And Squarespace itself recommends using 7.1 for new builds because new features focus there. 

So the only way to use 7.0 dev mode would be:

Start an entirely new 7.0 site on a 7.0 template, rebuild, migrate content, move domain.
For this project (existing C+B already on 7.1 + “light membership”), that’s almost certainly the wrong tradeoff.

My recommendation for C+B (7.1)
Stay on Squarespace 7.1 and do this:

Build a Section Library page (Not Linked)

Create 10–15 Saved Sections that represent the whole site’s building blocks

Put your “system” into global CSS tokens + rules

Use collections/summary blocks for anything that needs global updating

Document for the client: “To add a page: create page → insert sections A/B/C → swap images/text.”

If you want, paste a screenshot of the current C+B editor view (or tell me whether it’s Fluid Engine everywhere), and I’ll propose a concrete Phase 1 Section Library list tailored to your actual pages (Home/Learn/Services/Community/Stories) and the “content-forward + light membership” goals.

Fuck. Ok. Ok. My goal then is to have custom code for ALL styling of our elements. I want to do an absolute MINIMUM of work in squarespace's 7.1 visual design system. I am not a visual designer. I am a programmer. So with this in mind, guide me through inputting all possible aspects of the site components that we can account for in code, and then the bare minimum work that we need to do in the squarespace UI for these omponents to be client-editable / reusable in terms of very simple edits like text that goes in a box, or the image that goes in a box, etc, etc. Out cliet does NOT need to make edits any more complicated than this. Make sense?
ChatGPT said:
Yep — makes complete sense. The winning pattern in Squarespace 7.1 for a “programmer-first, client-editable” build is:

Let Squarespace store the content (text/images/buttons) in normal blocks, but make the site look and behave like your custom system via global CSS (and small JS).
You touch the visual editor only to (1) place blocks in roughly the right order, and (2) save sections for reuse.

Below is a step-by-step plan that gets you maximum styling in code and minimum UI work.

The core strategy
What lives in code (you)
Type scale, colors, spacing system, grid rules

Button styles, form styles, nav styles, card styles

“Section components” via CSS classes + predictable structure

Responsive behavior (mobile-first)

Small enhancements (accordion, tab switching, sticky CTA, etc.) via JS

What lives in the Squarespace UI (client)
Edit headline text, body text

Swap images

Change button labels + links

Add a new page by inserting prebuilt “saved sections” and editing content

Step 0 — Choose the minimum-work editing mode
Use Fluid Engine, but treat it like a dumb container.

You’re not “designing” with it.

You’re only dropping in blocks and letting your CSS do the layout.

In each section, you’ll set blocks to full-width (or a simple consistent width) and stop touching pixel placement.

If the site currently has classic editor sections mixed in, that’s fine — the method still works.

Step 1 — Establish a “Design System” in one place (global code)
You want one place to control everything:

Put this in ONE of these (pick one and stick with it)
Design → Custom CSS (best for CSS-only system)

Settings → Advanced → Code Injection → HEADER (best if you want to load one external CSS file + JS file)

My recommendation: Code Injection with external files, so you can version-control your system.

Structure
Create a tiny “theme” repo locally:

/cnb-theme
  /dist
    cnb.css
    cnb.js
  /src
    tokens.css
    base.css
    components.css
    sections.css
    utilities.css
    cnb.js
Then paste cnb.css into Squarespace (or host it and link it).

Goal: Every visual decision is controlled here.

Step 2 — Use CSS tokens like a real design system
In tokens.css, define everything:

Colors

Font sizes

Spacing scale

Border radius

Shadow

Container widths

Breakpoints

Example (conceptually):

--space-1…--space-8

--font-size-1…--font-size-6

--radius-1…--radius-3

--container-max

Now every component uses tokens, not random values.

Step 3 — Force a consistent layout without “dragging”
This is the key part.

A) Decide your global layout pattern
For example:

All page content sits inside a centered container max-width

Sections have consistent vertical padding

Grids snap at breakpoints (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)

B) Apply it globally with CSS targeting Squarespace’s structure
Squarespace wraps blocks/sections with consistent classes in 7.1. You’ll write CSS that:

Sets consistent paddings on sections

Normalizes typography inside text blocks

Normalizes images and buttons

Controls gaps between blocks

You’re essentially “skinning” Squarespace.

Step 4 — Build “components” as Saved Sections, but styled by CSS classes
Since Squarespace won’t give you custom section types, you create them like this:

Your workflow for each reusable component section
Add a new section in the page

Add only the blocks the client should edit (text, image, buttons)

Add a single Code Block at the top of the section containing only a tiny marker (not styling)

Your CSS uses that marker to style the entire section as a component

Save the section as a Saved Section

Why a Code Block marker?
Because Squarespace doesn’t give you “add a class to section” reliably in the UI.

So you create your own “component tag” inside the section. Example marker text:

<div class="cnb-section cnb-hero"></div>

Then your CSS can target .cnb-hero and apply layout rules to the rest of the section content.

UI work remains minimal: insert blocks; no visual tweaking.

Step 5 — Create a component library page (your assembly line)
Make a Not-Linked page called “Section Library” and build:

10–15 Saved Sections that cover Phase 1, like:

Hero (image + headline + subcopy + CTA)

Editorial split (image left/text right)

Card grid (3 cards)

Quote/testimonial

“Dinner Party” feature strip

CTA banner

FAQ accordion (text blocks)

Simple image gallery strip

“Story list” section (auto pulling from blog if used)

Once this exists, building new pages is:

Insert Saved Sections

Replace text/images

Done

Step 6 — Make client edits dead-simple
Your client should only do these actions:

Click text → edit

Click image → replace

Click button → change label/link

Insert a Saved Section → repeat

So you must avoid patterns that require:

moving blocks around

resizing columns

adjusting padding/margins in UI

All spacing comes from your CSS system.

Step 7 — Use collections for anything that should update everywhere
If “Stories” is a blog/collection, then your homepage “featured stories” should be a Summary/collection display so:

client adds a story once

it shows up everywhere automatically

This avoids duplicate edits.

Step 8 — Minimal JS only for behaviors Squarespace can’t do
Examples:

Accordion toggles

Tabs

Sticky mobile CTA

“Reveal on scroll” (optional)

Navbar behavior

Keep it lightweight and maintainable.

The bare minimum UI work, in concrete terms
For each page/section, you will do ONLY:

Add section

Add the editable blocks (text/image/button)

Paste a tiny marker element in a Code Block (one-liner)

Save section

No dragging things into place. No “nudging” columns.

One clarifying question (so I can give you the exact build recipe)
When you add a Code Block in your Squarespace 7.1 editor, do you have access to:

Code Block that renders HTML, and

Code Injection (header/footer) on the plan you’re on?

If yes, perfect — we’ll do the marker-based component system above.

If no (rare), we’ll switch to a “structure-only blocks + global selectors” approach that targets sections based on their block order, but it’s more brittle.

Next step: I’ll give you a concrete “starter kit”
If you answer the one question above, I’ll reply with:

the exact Code Injection snippet (CSS + JS loading)

a token-based CSS file structure

8–12 component section patterns mapped to your C+B pages

the exact “marker snippet” to paste per component

the “rules” for how to build each section in the UI with minimal clicks

And we’ll make this a repeatable factory for both C+B and Lillier (Shopify can get an even cleaner version of this same system).

You said:
We have custom code injection for only site header and footer. We have no code block option. We also have custom injection code sections for Lock Page, Order Confirmation Page, and Order Status Page. So with all of this in mind, help me start implementing the c n b site steps as per the client's specifications, utilizing our preferred methodology. Thanks. Consult resources provided earlier.

Thought for 3m 35s
You can get very close to a “dev-first / client-editable” workflow in Squarespace 7.1 even with only Header/Footer injection and no Code Blocks—but the trick is accepting one reality:

Squarespace 7.1 won’t let you ship truly custom “components” as first-class blocks/templates (like a theme repo). So the most efficient approach is:

You write the entire visual system in your own CSS/JS codebase

Squarespace becomes a content assembler (text/images/buttons/forms) inside a small set of “section recipes”

You turn those recipes into Saved Sections (the discrete chunks the client can reuse) 

You use Section IDs (anchors) as stable hooks so your code can style and enhance each section predictably 

Below is the cleanest build plan for Cupcakes + Broccoli (Squarespace 7.1) given your constraints, aligned with the page architecture you have in the CnB doc (Home, About, Work With Amanda, Learn, Stories, Blind Dinners, Membership, Login). 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


The best “programmer-first” Squarespace 7.1 methodology
A) Build a real codebase (so you’re not “coding inside Squarespace”)
Create a repo like:

cnb-lillier-ui/
  /src
    to:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}js
  /dist
    cnb.bundle.css
    cnb.bundle.js
Goal: 95% of “design decisions” live in your repo, not in Squarespace’s visual controls.

Deployment options (pick what’s easiest):

Host assets externally (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, GitHub Pages) and load them via <link> / <script> in Squarespace injection (fast iteration, best for you).

Inline CSS/JS directly in injection (quick start, but gets messy as it grows).

Given you want flexibility and minimal UI fiddling, #1 is usually best.

B) Use Squarespace Saved Sections as your reusable “component library”
Squarespace lets you save any section layout to reuse later (heart icon → Saved Sections). 

So your “components” become Saved Sections, but they’re made from native blocks (Text, Image, Button, Form, Summary, etc.) that the client can edit later.

You build each section once, save it, and reuse it everywhere.

C) Use Section IDs as your “props API”
Because you don’t have code blocks or custom HTML per section, your main stable hook is:

Section settings → Advanced → Section ID (built-in anchors on 7.1) 

You’ll style and enhance like:

/* example */
#cnb-hero .sqs-block-button-element { ... }
#cnb-pricing .sqs-block-content { ... }
This is how you avoid wrestling with Fluid Engine micro-positioning: your CSS enforces spacing, typography, layout rules.

What you do in Squarespace vs in code (clean split)
You do in your codebase (most of the work)
Typography system (type scale, tracking, line-height)

Spacing system (padding/margins/section rhythm)

Buttons (sizes, hover, focus, disabled)

Editorial grid rules (columns, card grids, image crops)

Global colors + “pattern / textile” accents as CSS background treatments

Mobile-first layout logic

Light interactivity: sticky header, nav behavior, modal overlay for “Ask a Question” (even if it’s a Phase 1 placeholder)

You do in Squarespace UI (bare minimum, but unavoidable)
Create pages + navigation order

Drop in the native content blocks (so client can edit text/images)

Assign Section IDs

Save sections to Saved Sections library

Configure Member Sites (membership gating) + pricing plans

Step-by-step: start implementing C+B now (Phase 1 build)
Step 0 — Work safely (staging)
Duplicate the existing C+B site so you have a staging build target (you’re already on the existing URL/site per client email).

Confirm the live site remains untouched until your final QA.

Step 1 — Add your “theme layer” through Header/Footer injection
Squarespace supports site-wide code injection; JS needs <script> and CSS can be injected via <style> or external stylesheet. 

Where: Settings → Advanced → Code Injection

Header Injection (recommended minimal skeleton):

<!-- C+B Theme Layer -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://YOUR-CDN.com/cnb.bundle.css?v=1" />

<script>
  // quick site flag you can use in CSS/JS
  window.__SITE = "cnb";
</script>
Footer Injection (JS loads after DOM):

<script defer src="https://YOUR-CDN.com/cnb.bundle.js?v=1"></script>
If you can’t host externally yet, inline a short version first:

<style>
  :root{
    --cnb-bg:#0b0b0b;
    --cnb-fg:#f2f2f2;
    --cnb-accent:#d7b46a;
    --space-1:8px; --space-2:12px; --space-3:16px; --space-4:24px; --space-5:32px;
    --radius:18px;
  }
</style>
Step 2 — Create your C+B page tree (based on the doc)
Create these top-level pages in Squarespace navigation (Phase 1 list reflected in the CnB navigation doc):

Home

About

Work With Amanda

Learn

Stories

Blind Dinners

Membership

Login

(Even if some pages are light shells at first, the nav + routing needs to exist so you can build templates once and reuse.)

Step 3 — Build a “Section Library” as Saved Sections (your real acceleration)
Make 10–12 Saved Sections total. That’s your component system.

Here’s a practical C+B Phase 1 set:

Hero (Editorial)
Native blocks: Image + Text + Button
Section ID: cnb-hero

**Two-column Feature (Im
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…

 blocks: Image + Text + Button
Section ID: cnb-split

Card Grid (3-up, collapses to 1-up mobile)
Native blocks: Summary block (or 3 Images + 3 Text blocks)
Section ID: cnb-cardgrid

Pull Quote / Editorial Statement
Native blocks: Text
Section ID: cnb-quote

“Dinner Party” Highlight band (since this is a major brand differentiator per kickoff)
Native blocks: Image collage + Text + Button
Section ID: cnb-dinners-highlight

Services teaser (links to Work With Amanda / Services)
Native blocks: Text + Button(s)
Section ID: cnb-services-teaser

Learn Library teaser
Native blocks: Summary / list style
Section ID: cnb-learn-teaser

Stories grid
Native blocks: Blog or Summary block
Section ID: cnb-stories-grid

CTA band (“Join the Community”)
Native blocks: Text + Button
Section ID: cnb-cta

Footer CTA / Newsletter (if used)
Native blocks: Newsletter or Form
Section ID: cnb-newsletter

As you build each once: save it as a Saved Section so you never rebuild it again. 

Step 4 — Membership setup the Squarespace-native way (light logic, maximum editability)
For “light membership”, Squarespace Member Sites is built for exactly this (gated pages behind paywall). 

Important implementation detail: Squarespace recommends creating a public sign-up page that contains digital product blocks for each pricing plan so visitors can compare and purchase. 

Your docs already define two tiers and pricing (Core $25 / Premium $59). 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Pragmatic approach (no heavy custom logic):

Create one Member Site (“C+B Community”)

Create two pricing plans inside it: Core and Premium (matching the doc)

Put all gated pages under that Member Site

Build your public “Membership” page with:

Pricing comparison section

Two “Join” buttons using Squarespace digital product blocks (Core plan + Premium plan)

This keeps:

gating + login + subscription billing handled by Squarespace

your UI consistent (because your CSS styles the membership page + paywall)

Step 5 — Implement the “AI concierge overlay” as Phase 1 UI (optional but low-effort)
Your CnB doc describes an “Ask a question” CTA opening an overlay/modal and returning the user to their scroll position. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Even if real AI is Phase
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…

 behavior** now with injected JS:

If a button links to #ask (normal Squarespace button)

Your JS intercepts that click and opens a modal you generate in JS

Modal can contain:

“Coming soon” + email capture (Form block won’t embed into JS, but you can link to a Squarespace form page or a lightweight external form)

Or just a styled prompt + CTA to membership

This gives the product feel without building backend logic.

The “minimum Squarespace UI work” rules (so you don’t get dragged into design)
Use these constraints while building pages:

Never hand-tune spacing with spacers except as a last resort
Your CSS should enforce section padding and block spacing inside each Section ID.

**Use the same block types eve

 CSS stays predictable.

Only build new layouts as Saved Sections
If it isn’t reusable, it doesn’t get invented.

Blind Dinners = hero + editorial story + CTA

Membership = pricing comparison + join buttons (digital product blocks)

Membership (as soon as you have gating clarity)
Create Member Site + pricing plans (Core/Premium) 

Move gated pages under Member Site

Customize paywall copy (and style it with your CSS)

One key warning (so you don’
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…

space Member Sites can do tiered pricing, but fine-grained “Core can see some pages, Premium can see more” can get annoying unless you structure carefully. If you want truly granular access-control without duplicating content, that’s where third-party membership tools (or a different platform) sometimes become necessary—but since Phase 1 explicitly avoids heavy custom logic, the Squarespace-native approach above is the most efficient path to launch. 
If you want, I can turn this into a concrete “build map” for C+B Home page + Membership page that includes:

exactly which native Squarespace blocks to add (in order)

what to name each Section ID

What is this inn our repo:     to:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}js ?
ChatGPT said:
That string is not real JavaScript and it’s almost certainly an accidental artifact from an AI/citation system, not something you (or Squarespace/Shopify) should ever ship.

What it is
to:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}js

oaicite / contentReference are internal citation markers some AI tools insert when they’re trying to attach sources.

If it’s showing up in your repo, it usually means:

someone copy/pasted text from an AI chat response that included hidden citation markup, or

a formatter/MD-to-HTML step accidentally preserved it as literal text.

What to do
Search the repo for oaicite and contentReference.

If you’re in the repo root:

Windows PowerShell:

Select-String -Path .\* -Pattern "oaicite|contentReference" -Recurse
macOS/Linux:

grep -RIn "oaicite\|contentReference" .
Delete it wherever it appears. It has no valid purpose in production code.

If it’s inside a JS file and causing errors, it might be breaking a line like:

to:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}js
Just remove that entire token/line.

If it appears inside a template / markdown / CMS content
Remove it from the source content and re-run your build.

If you’re using any “AI export” or “copy with citations” workflow, turn off citations or copy as plain text.

Quick sanity check
If you paste the 3–10 lines above and below it (and tell me which file it’s in), I’ll tell you exactly what to remove and what the line was probably supposed to be.

(But bottom line: it’s junk and safe to delete.)

Thanks for confirming your preferred coding approach and platform constraints. To help build the Cupcakes + Broccoli site efficiently within Squarespace 7.1 using your preferred methodology, I want to confirm a few implementation details so I can give you a precise step-by-step action plan:

Are you planning to use GitHub as the repo for storing and versioning custom HTML/CSS/JS that you then manually copy/paste into the Squarespace header/footer injection areas?

For layout-level design (grids, section stacking, block spacing), would you prefer to:

Use Squarespace sections minimally, with each acting as a hook for injected code-defined layout/components

Or structure the page mostly visually (in Squarespace) and apply styling overrides only?

For the AI concierge modal—do you want to mock that in Phase 1 with placeholder text and layout, or wire it up to an actual service from the start?

Are you expecting to simulate membership-based gating via Squarespace’s built-in Member Areas feature, or build a lighter custom gating approach?

Will you allow any dynamic content like JS-injected prompts/examples on the homepage (e.g. AI prompt cards), or should all interaction be statically styled for now?

Once I know how you’d like to structure the above, I’ll outline a precise, step-by-step methodology for building the site in code-first style inside Squarespace 7.1. Let me know!

2. MINIMAL use of squarespace sections, as stated above previously many many times already.

Cupcakes + Broccoli Squarespace 7.1 Implementation Plan (Code-First Approach)
Overview and Goals
Cupcakes + Broccoli’s website will be built on Squarespace 7.1 with a code-first approach to achieve a custom design while keeping the Squarespace visual editor usage minimal. The goal is to create a mobile-first site that shares design DNA with its Shopify counterpart (Lillier) and is easy for the client to edit basic content (text/images) without touching code. Key objectives include:
Use GitHub for code management: All HTML snippets, CSS, and JS will be stored and version-controlled on GitHub. The Squarespace site will pull these in via code injection (global header/footer and special pages) rather than relying on drag-and-drop design.
Minimal Squarespace sections: We will use Squarespace sections as lightweight editable shells or hooks – essentially placeholders where the client can later update text or swap images via the Squarespace editor. Complex layouts and styling will be handled by custom code, not by the Squarespace UI.
Content-forward, reusable sections: The design will prioritize content (text, imagery) and use a library of section templates that can be reused across pages. This ensures consistency and easy extension (the client can duplicate a section for a new page and just edit content).
Lightweight content gating: Implement a simple custom solution to gate member-only content (e.g. certain “Stories” or resources) without using the full Squarespace Member Areas feature. This avoids a heavy SaaS-style member portal while still restricting access to premium content.
AI concierge modal (Phase 1): Include a non-functional placeholder for the Cupcakes + Broccoli AI Concierge – likely an overlay/modal launched from the home page – to be styled and positioned per design, but just a static dummy for now.
No live dynamic data (Phase 1): All interactive or dynamic-looking elements (e.g. the AI concierge Q&A, membership status) will be implemented with static front-end code or dummy content. No live API calls or backend integration are planned in this phase, which keeps complexity low.
This plan is a step-by-step developer-ready guide balancing flexibility and maintainability with ease of handoff. In each step, we reference project documents for page structure and goals to ensure alignment with the intended architecture.
1. GitHub Repository Setup and File Structure
Set up a dedicated GitHub repository to manage all custom code for the Squarespace site. Organize the repository for clarity and long-term maintenance:
CSS: Create a css/ directory for styles. Use logical separation such as:
css/main.css – Global site styles (typography, layout, header/footer styling, common section styles).
css/pages/… – Optional sub-files for page-specific CSS if needed (e.g. home.css for the home page hero and special elements, about.css, etc.). Keep these small; prefer combining into main.css if possible to reduce file requests.
css/special.css – Styles for Squarespace system pages (lock screen, etc.) if they need distinct CSS tweaks (could also be included in main.css with scoped selectors).
JS: Create a js/ directory for scripts. Examples:
js/main.js – Core JavaScript to be loaded on all pages (e.g. navigation enhancements, footer behaviors, any site-wide interactions).
js/ai-concierge.js – Specific script for the AI concierge modal behavior (Phase 1 placeholder). This can be included in main.js or separate if you prefer to toggle it on only the home page.
Keep scripts modular and well-commented for clarity. No external API calls should be present – any “dynamic” behavior will be simulated or left as a stub for future implementation.
HTML: If there are significant chunks of custom HTML (for example, a complex component that will be injected via code block or script), you can store them in the repo as .html snippet files for versioning. For instance, html/ai-modal.html could contain the markup for the AI concierge modal. In practice, this HTML might be directly included via code injection or a Code Block in Squarespace, but having it in GitHub ensures changes are tracked.
Assets: An assets/ directory can hold any custom images, SVGs, or font files if needed. However, for content images that the client will swap, plan to use Squarespace’s built-in image management (so the client can replace via the editor). Only store design assets that are truly static (e.g. an SVG icon used in styling) in the code repo.
README: Document the project structure and any build/deploy process. While Squarespace doesn’t have a build pipeline, note in the README how to update the Squarespace site with the latest code (e.g. “copy main.css content into Squarespace header injection” or if using external hosting, how to point to the latest version). This will help during handoff.
Rationale: A clear file structure makes it easy to find and update parts of the code. Using GitHub for version control means any changes to styling or scripts can be tracked and rolled back if needed, supporting the goal of maintainability. It also allows collaboration or review before pushing updates to the live site.
2. Squarespace Configuration for Code Injection
Next, prepare the Squarespace 7.1 site to receive custom code. Squarespace 7.1 does not support Developer Mode (no full template code access), so we will leverage Code Injection for global modifications
. Ensure the site is on a plan that supports code injection (Business or higher, as required by Squarespace)
. Key steps:
Global Header Injection: In Squarespace’s Settings → Advanced → Code Injection, add a <style> link or tag for the CSS, and any <script> tags needed in the header. For maintainability, link to external files on GitHub or another host if possible. For example, you could host main.css and main.js on GitHub Pages or another CDN and include:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://YOUR_CDN_URL/css/main.css">
and similar for the script:
<script src="https://YOUR_CDN_URL/js/main.js" defer></script>
This way, updates just require pushing to GitHub (which updates the CDN) without manually copy-pasting code. If an external host is not feasible, you can paste the raw CSS inside <style>…</style> tags and JS inside <script>…</script> tags in the injection panel
. Keep the code organized and commented even in this panel for clarity.
Global Footer Injection: Use the footer code injection for any scripts that should load at the end of the body. In our case, since we’ll defer most JS (using the defer attribute or placing in footer), you can include the main JS here if not already linked in header. The footer is also a good place for any inlined script that needs to execute after the DOM is ready. Make sure to wrap any inline JS in <script> tags
.
Per-Page Injection (if needed): Squarespace allows page-specific code injection (in page settings). We will keep most code global, but if a certain script or style should only run on a specific page (e.g. home page hero special effect), you can add a small snippet in that page’s “Page Header Code Injection” field
. We will avoid heavy use of this to keep things consolidated, but it’s an option for page-specific tweaks. (Note: Squarespace recommends not injecting large HTML in page header injection, and transparency settings can affect it
, so we’ll primarily use it only for small scripts or to set body classes if needed.)
Special Pages Injection: Squarespace provides separate code injection fields for system pages like the Lock Page, Order Confirmation, and Order Status pages
. Use these for code that should run only on those pages. For example, if we are using a password-protected page as a lightweight gating solution, we can style the Lock Page (password entry screen) via its injection field with custom HTML/CSS (e.g., a branded message or custom styling so it doesn’t look like a generic Squarespace lock page). Similarly, if any commerce elements (order confirmed or status) are used, we can inject styles to ensure they match the site design. For Phase 1 of Cupcakes + Broccoli, full commerce might not be used on Squarespace (since Lillier/Shopify handles store), but this is ready if needed.
Maintainability tips: Keep the injected code as lean as possible. Leverage external files for bulk code. Also, document in the GitHub repo or a shared document which code is injected where. For example, note that “main.css linked in header injection” and “special CSS for lock page is in Lock Page code injection panel (with corresponding code in repo).” This helps future developers or the client’s team know where to look if something needs changing.
3. Content Structure with Minimal Squarespace Sections
With the site ready for code, set up the pages and sections in Squarespace to serve as content hooks. We will create the main pages as per the site architecture (from the navigation and taxonomy documents): Top-Level Pages (Squarespace):
Home – Landing page with multiple content sections (hero, “What This Is” intro, AI Concierge intro, Learn, Work With Amanda, Blind Dinners, Membership teaser, closing section) as outlined in the content doc.
About – About the platform and Amanda Johnson’s story (text-heavy with perhaps images).
Work With Amanda – Page describing consulting/advisory services.
Learn – Resource library landing page (likely will contain links or listings for tools, frameworks, etc.).
Stories – Blog or articles section (likely implemented as a Blog collection in Squarespace for easy publishing of stories from founders, etc.).
Blind Dinners – Info page about Blind Dinners (mostly static content and perhaps a way to express interest).
Membership – Sales page for membership, with tier details and a call-to-action to join (the content doc even provides copy for Core vs Premium tiers).
Login – This may not be an actual page but a login URL. If using Squarespace’s Member Area or a custom login, this would be handled differently (possibly the login button triggers a Squarespace login popup or directs to a lock page). We’ll include a persistent login button in the header as specified.
For each page, follow these steps to create minimalistic sections:
Use Blank Sections: In the Squarespace page editor, add blank sections for each distinct content block. Avoid using pre-designed layouts; we just need plain containers that we’ll style via CSS. For example, on the Home page, add a blank section for the hero, another for the “What This Is” content, another for the AI concierge teaser, etc., corresponding to each content group in the home page outline. Do the same for other pages (e.g., About might be one or two sections, Stories index might use a blog section or summary block).
Insert minimal content blocks: Within each section, add only the basic elements needed for content that the client will edit:
For text content (headings, paragraphs), use Text Blocks. Type in the placeholder or actual text from the copy document. Do not worry about formatting (we’ll handle typography and positioning with CSS). If needed, break into multiple text blocks for semantic separation (e.g., one text block for a heading, another for a paragraph, so the client can edit them separately). You can also use the HTML editor within a text block to add span tags or classes if needed, but prefer to keep it simple for the client – rather add distinguishing classes via JavaScript after load if needed.
For images, use Image Blocks. This allows the client to replace the image via the Squarespace interface later. For instance, if the design calls for a hero background image or an inline image on a page, place an image block in that section. We can set it to a placeholder image (to be replaced with final photography). Through CSS, you might reposition or resize it, but using the block ensures the client can swap the image in the same spot.
For any list of items (like a grid of resources or stories), you have options: you can either use native Squarespace summary blocks or collection blocks (like a Blog for Stories), or simply hard-code the structure. Since we prefer code-first, we might use a Code Block for something like a custom HTML structure for a grid. However, remember the client can’t easily edit content inside a raw HTML Code Block without some technical know-how. So a compromise: if stories are a blog, let Squarespace handle the blog index and then style it via CSS. If resources under “Learn” are static, maybe each resource can be a small piece of content the client can edit (or a list we manage as static HTML but maybe not ideal). We’ll choose the approach per section:
Stories: Implement as a blog collection for ease of adding new stories. We will style the blog index page (and blog post pages) with CSS to fit the design. Member-only stories can be flagged (via a Category or Tag like “Members”) so we can visually indicate or restrict them (more on gating later).
Learn: Could be a regular page listing resource links. Possibly use a Summary Block to pull excerpts of “resource” posts, or manually list them in a text block with links. This depends on how these resources are stored – if they are also blog posts or pages. For Phase 1, a simple page with sections for each type of content (tools, frameworks, etc.) might suffice, with each item perhaps linking to a PDF or blog post. Again, use minimal text blocks for titles and descriptions; style them later.
Membership tiers: On the Membership page, rather than using a Squarespace pricing block, we can manually layout the two tiers using text and maybe an image or icon, to have full control with CSS. For example, two column text blocks or a small HTML in a Code Block. If the client needs to tweak the pricing or description, having them as normal text is best. We’ll just ensure our CSS can target those elements to apply the proper design (like making the price large, etc.).
Assign identifiers for styling: Squarespace doesn’t let you directly add IDs to sections in the UI, but each section gets a unique data-section-id and an optional name if you label the section in the editor (you can label a section for your own reference). We can use these auto-generated IDs or HTML structure to target sections. Alternatively, add a Code Block at the top of a section with a simple wrapped <div id="home-hero-section"></div> around the content to serve as a hook, but this is usually not necessary. We can mostly rely on nth-of-type or section indexes if the structure is consistent. For clarity, we might note the section IDs by inspecting the published site and use them in our CSS comments (e.g. /* Home hero section: section #block-yui-1234... */). This way, if Squarespace regenerates an ID (rare unless section is recreated), we can update it.
Ensure sections remain editable: Avoid adding complex code that the client might accidentally break in the visual editor. For instance, do not encourage the client to edit anything inside a Code Block – keep those for structures that won’t require client changes. All user-editable content (text paragraphs, headings, images) should be in normal blocks. That way, the client can use Squarespace’s in-line editor to change copy or replace an image without messing up HTML structure. The custom code will style these elements externally.
By the end of this step, we’ll have all pages set up in Squarespace with the correct sections and basic content in place (using the copy from the provided documents). The site will look very plain at this point, but it establishes the “hooks” we need: each piece of content exists and can be targeted via CSS/JS. Example – Home Page Structure:
Hero Section: Blank section with a Text Block for the headline (“Black ownership is Black survival…”), a Text Block for subhead, another for body copy, and perhaps two Button Blocks or linked Text for the primary CTA (“Join Membership”) and secondary CTA (“Learn More”). We might also include an Image Block if there’s a decorative image or background (or set a background image for the section via Squarespace’s section background setting, which the client can also change if needed).
“What This Is” Section: Blank section with Text Blocks for the headline (“Built Around Experience”) and body text. The inline link “Learn how Cupcakes + Broccoli works → About page” can be a part of that text block (the Squarespace editor allows hyperlinking text). We will style it to look like a nice link or button via CSS.
AI Concierge Teaser Section: Blank section with Text Blocks for the headline (“Ask What You Are Actually Stuck On”) and body explaining the AI concierge, plus perhaps a list of example prompts. We’ll also put a button or link “Ask a question” which will later trigger the modal. This button could be a standard Squarespace Button Block or a text link styled as a button – either way we will intercept its click with JS to open the modal.
Learn Section (Home page): Text for headline “Practical Learning You Can Use” and body, plus a CTA link “Explore Resources → Learn page”.
Work With Amanda Section (Home): Text for headline and body and CTA.
Blind Dinners Section (Home): Text for headline and body and CTA.
Membership Section (Home): Text for headline and body, and CTA buttons for “Join Membership” and “Compare Membership Options”.
Closing Section: Text for closing statement (“Ownership Is a Practice”) and final CTA link.
Each of these sections on the home page corresponds to content from the provided documents, ensuring we cover the intended messaging. Other pages will be structured in a similar breakdown. For instance, the About page might have sections for “This Is a Founder-Led Practice” (intro about Cupcakes+Broccoli) and “Who Amanda Is” (Amanda’s bio), broken into editable text blocks.
4. Injecting Custom CSS for Styling
With content in place, we implement the design through CSS. All custom styles will live in our main.css (and any supplementary CSS files) that we prepared in GitHub. We will inject this CSS site-wide via the <style> link or tag in the header (as set up in step 2). Key guidelines for CSS:
Global Styles and Reset: First, include any CSS reset/normalize to ensure consistency across browsers (you can use a mild reset or just zero-out margins on sections, etc.). Then define global typography styles (fonts, base font-size, line-heights) and color variables (Squarespace allows adding custom CSS freely, so you can use CSS variables or just hardcode values from the design spec). This ensures the site’s text and basic elements use the design’s font (likely the design partners specified a font). You can add the font via an @import or <link> if it’s a Google Font, or via the Squarespace font picker if it’s easier (though code-first suggests we might directly include it in CSS).
Section and Layout Styling: For each section (hero, about, etc.), write CSS rules to achieve the desired layout:
Use the Squarespace section structure to target elements. For example, Squarespace sections typically have a structure like <section data-section-id="..."><div class="section-content"><div class="row"><div class="col">.... You can target by the data-section-id or by using nth-of-type if the order is fixed. E.g., if the Home page hero is the first section on that page, section:nth-of-type(1) h1 { ... } could style the hero headline. A more robust approach is to use a custom identifier: if the hero’s heading text is unique, you could target it via its content or add a span with a class in the text. Alternatively, once the site is published, inspect and copy the section[data-section-id] for the hero and use that in the CSS (e.g. section[data-section-id="5f4c..."] { /* hero styles */ }). Document which ID corresponds to which section for clarity.
Positioning and Spacing: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox as needed to reposition elements. For instance, if you want text and image side by side, you could inject an extra wrapper via a Code Block or directly use CSS to make the section’s column into two columns. Many Squarespace blank sections by default stack content vertically; you can override by selecting the section in the editor and choosing a layout (like two columns) for that section if it helps, then Squarespace will handle the basic column HTML. But if we want full custom control, we might keep everything in one column and use our CSS to split content into columns or absolutely position an image. Use media queries (or flex-wrap) to ensure it’s mobile-friendly (design is mobile-first, so perhaps design expects single column on mobile, two columns on desktop, etc.).
Typography and Colors: Apply styles to headings, paragraphs, and links to match the design language. From the content, we see some phrases like “These stories are not performance. They are perspective.” which might be displayed in a special stylistic way. Ensure block quotes or emphasized text have appropriate styling. Use the brand colors for backgrounds or text as needed.
Buttons and CTAs: Style the CTA links and buttons consistently. The “Join Membership” or “Ask a question” should have a distinct button style. If using actual Button Blocks from Squarespace, override their classes (Squarespace buttons have classes like .sqs-block-button-element). If using text links, style those anchors to look like buttons (with padding, background, border radius, etc.). Make sure the login button in the header is styled as per design – perhaps a special highlight style to be obvious (the content doc notes a persistent login button, likely as a styled element in the nav).
Navigation & Header: Use CSS to customize the header navigation. We likely use the default Squarespace header for functionality (logo, menu, etc.) but we can override styling to match the design. For example, if we need the “Login” to appear as a button on the right, and other links normal, we can target that link specifically (maybe by its text or position) and style it differently (add a background, etc.). If the template does not support a persistent top banner, consider enabling the fixed header option in Squarespace (if available) or use CSS position: fixed on the header. Ensure the mobile menu styles are adjusted if needed (Squarespace will generate a mobile menu; we can style the hamburger icon or menu background to fit the brand).
Footer: Style the footer similarly. If using Squarespace’s default footer (with maybe some text or social links), we can keep it simple but match colors/spacing. Or if a custom footer is needed, we could treat it like other sections: minimal content in editor, then style via CSS.
Responsive (Mobile-First): Ensure the CSS is written mobile-first (as the goal is mobile-friendly). That means designing for small screens by default, then using @media (min-width: X) for larger screens to enhance layout. E.g., on mobile the hero section text might be centered and stacked, while on desktop it could be split with an image. Test across common breakpoints. Squarespace 7.1 is responsive out-of-the-box, but since we override a lot, we must explicitly handle responsiveness. For example, if we manually create columns using CSS grid, add a media query to stack them on narrow screens.
Testing CSS in Squarespace: As you develop the CSS, you can paste it into Site Styles → Custom CSS editor temporarily for live preview (Squarespace has a Custom CSS panel which shows changes in real-time). This is handy for quick iteration. Once satisfied, move the CSS to the code injection for final (the CSS editor and code injection can both be used, but it’s best to consolidate usage to one method to avoid confusion). Remember, Squarespace’s custom CSS editor has a 128k character limit
 – our CSS should stay well under this, but it’s a consideration if the design were very large. We can always link external CSS to bypass that limit entirely.
Throughout styling, refer back to the design specs (component/system guidelines from the design partner) to maintain consistency. The code-forward approach allows us to implement those specs precisely. For instance, if the design system defines a specific card style for “Stories” excerpts, we will implement that in CSS rather than relying on a native Squarespace block style. Maintainability: Keep the CSS organized with comments indicating sections/pages. For example:
/* Home – Hero Section */
section[data-section-id="..."] h1.hero-title { ... } 
This helps future developers (or a tech-savvy client contact) quickly find where to adjust styles for a given section. Use understandable class names and avoid overly specific selectors so minor content changes (like adding an extra text block) don’t break the layout. Also, document any Squarespace quirks – e.g., “using !important to override a Squarespace default here” or “targeting this button by nth-child because Squarespace doesn’t give an ID”.
5. Injecting Custom JavaScript for Interactivity
Next, implement JavaScript to handle any interactive elements or enhancements, keeping in mind that everything remains static/offline in Phase 1. Place the JavaScript in main.js (or split into multiple files as planned) and load it via code injection (preferably in the footer or deferred)
. Key scripts to include:
AI Concierge Modal (Placeholder): The home page has an “Ask a question” CTA that should trigger the AI concierge modal. Implement a modal dialog in HTML/CSS and use JS to control its visibility:
Add the modal’s HTML structure either directly on the page (e.g., in a Code Block placed on the Home page but hidden by default) or inject it via JavaScript on page load. For example, your main.js can create a div with id="ai-concierge-modal" containing some placeholder content (maybe a mock chat interface or simply a message “AI Concierge coming soon…”). Insert this into the DOM (e.g., append to body).
Style the modal via CSS (in main.css) to be full-screen overlay, centered container, etc., matching whatever design is intended. The content can be minimal now – perhaps just a title, a paragraph explaining this will be an AI assistant, and a close button.
JS functionality: Add an event listener to the “Ask a question” button/link so that on click, it sets the modal to display: block (or adds an active class). Also, attach a listener to the modal’s close button (an “X” or “Close” text) to hide the modal and restore the page state. The content doc notes that the user should not navigate away and closing returns to same scroll position – since we’re using an overlay, we inherently stay on the page; just ensure document.body overflow is handled (maybe add overflow: hidden to body when modal opens to prevent background scroll).
Since this is a placeholder, we won’t implement actual AI chat logic. You might include a dummy input box and a disabled “Submit” button just for looks, but clearly mark in code that functionality is pending future development.
Navigation Behavior: If the design calls for any custom navigation behavior (for example, a header that changes on scroll, or a mobile menu customization), use JS to add those classes. For instance, a common enhancement is making the header shrink or add a background on scroll. We can detect scroll and toggle a class like .scrolled on the header. Another example: the login button might open a dropdown or login form – if we go that route, JS would handle showing a login form. However, given we want to avoid heavy custom member systems in Phase 1, the login link likely just goes to a standard Squarespace login page or member area prompt. So navigation JS might be minimal.
Content Gating Logic (if any in JS): For the lightweight gating, we might use JS to hide/show certain content based on a condition (like presence of a cookie or password). If we decide not to use Squarespace’s built-in page password for member content, an approach could be:
Have member-only articles (stories) still visible in the listing but when a user clicks, the page content is replaced by a prompt to login if they are not authorized. We could implement this by checking a cookie (for example, set a cookie when a member logs in via some custom form) and if not present, replace the article content with a message or redirect to membership page. This requires writing a script on the story pages. However, this is somewhat advanced and might be overkill for Phase 1. Alternatively, simpler: mark member-only stories with a label and just prevent access via Squarespace’s own password or leave them published but with a note. We will revisit gating in the next section – but any JS needed for it would be included here (e.g., reading localStorage or toggling content).
Miscellaneous UI enhancements: If there are any other dynamic elements – for instance, a carousel or lightbox – try to use Squarespace’s built-in features first or a lightweight approach. We want to avoid heavy libraries for now (performance and simplicity). If a carousel is needed and Squarespace doesn’t provide one in 7.1 by default, consider a minimal vanilla JS snippet or a well-tested lightweight library (added via script). But only include if absolutely necessary, given the “no live data” constraint, probably we can avoid slideshows for now (or use static images in a grid instead of a fancy slider).
Performance considerations: Because our JS is injected and runs after the page loads, be mindful of performance
. Keep the scripts efficient and initialize only what’s needed. Use defer on script tags (or place scripts at bottom) so they don’t block page render. Also, guard against errors – wrap custom code in try/catch or conditionals especially if manipulating DOM elements that might not exist (for example, check if the “Ask a question” button is on the page before attaching the event, so it doesn’t error out on other pages). This ensures one page’s functionality doesn’t break the whole site’s script execution.
All scripts should be thoroughly tested on the Squarespace site (both desktop and mobile) to ensure they work with Squarespace’s environment. For instance, test that the AI modal overlay appears over the Squarespace header and that the Squarespace responsive menu still works when our code is present. Also verify that our code doesn’t conflict with any Squarespace built-ins (naming collisions, etc.). Since we can’t modify Squarespace’s core JS, we have to work alongside it. Maintainability: Document any third-party code or unusual techniques in the repo. For example, if we use a known workaround to detect Squarespace login status via JS, comment it with a source link. Keep functions modular. In the GitHub README or a wiki, list the main interactive features and how to adjust them (e.g., “To change the behavior of the AI modal, see js/ai-concierge.js…”). This will help future developers and make handoff smoother.
6. Lightweight Content Gating Strategy
One of the project requirements is to implement light membership / gated content without using the full Squarespace Member Areas system. In practice, this means certain pages or resources (for example, some “Stories” or in-depth resources in the Learn library) should only be accessible to members, but we want to avoid the overhead and design of Squarespace’s membership portal. We will adopt a simple gating approach in Phase 1:
Public vs. Members-Only Content Identification: We will identify which content is members-only based on the project docs. The “Stories” section explicitly notes: “Some stories are shared publicly. Others are reserved for members. Membership makes space for deeper reflection, trust, and care.”. This suggests that within the blog, certain posts will be premium. Similarly, perhaps some resources in “Learn” are for members only. We can use a convention like tagging those items with a label “Members” (for stories, use a Category or Tag in the blog named “Members-Only”). On the front-end, we can visually indicate locked content by a small padlock icon or “Members Only” text on those items in the list, via CSS content or a conditional (Squarespace’s summary block might allow a little HTML in excerpts, or we overlay via CSS).
Gating Implementation Options:
Password-Protected Pages: The simplest non-member-area gate is to use Squarespace’s built-in password protection on pages or collections. For instance, we could put all member-only stories in a separate blog collection that is password-protected (so only those with the password can see it). Or lock the individual story pages with a password. The downside is one universal password that must be shared with members, but for Phase 1 this might be acceptable (especially if membership is small or manually managed). If we go this route, we will customize the Lock Page to have appropriate messaging. Using the Lock Page code injection, we can add a message like “This content is for Cupcakes+Broccoli members. Enter the member password to continue.” and style it with the site’s branding (so the experience feels integrated, not a default lock screen)
. Once the user enters the password, Squarespace will remember it for that session.
Lightweight Account System: If individual accounts are needed (e.g., each member has their own login), we could still use Squarespace Member Areas but keep it minimal. That would involve setting up a Member Area for, say, “Member Resources” and assigning certain pages (or the blog) to that area. Squarespace would handle login, account creation, and password reset (the doc hints that “Password reset [is] handled through standard Squarespace flow” which implies they considered using Squarespace’s account system). We would then strip away any unnecessary parts of the Member Area UI through CSS (hiding any Squarespace-generated “profile” or visuals, to avoid a dashboard feel). The member-only pages would then automatically require login. This is more robust than a single password, but also more setup (and possibly an extra cost on Squarespace’s plan). Given the directive to avoid a full member area, we might hold off on this unless the client explicitly wants individual accounts in Phase 1.
Custom Code Gating: As mentioned under JS, a purely custom approach could involve an external authentication (like a simple form that sets a cookie). For example, we could create a custom login page (or modal) where a member enters an email and a predetermined password, and if correct, we set a cookie member=true. Our JS would then check for member=true cookie and reveal member content. However, this approach has security considerations (we’d be effectively hardcoding a password in client-side code, not truly secure) and is not recommended for anything beyond a trivial gating. We likely won’t do this for real membership – it’s mentioned just for completeness. We prefer using Squarespace’s built-in mechanisms for security and simplicity.
For Phase 1, the most practical approach is a single shared password for member content, as an interim solution. We can provide this password to paid members manually. All member-only pages (or blog posts) would be placed under a locked section. Implementation steps:
Mark all premium Stories as “locked”. In Squarespace, you can assign a password to a blog page (the entire blog or individual posts if needed by putting them in a locked folder). We might create two blog pages: “Stories” (public) and “Member Stories” (locked), and on the main Stories index page, show public stories normally and for members, perhaps instruct them to log in to see more. Alternatively, a single blog with mixed content: public posts accessible normally, member posts when clicked would prompt for password. Squarespace doesn’t support per-post password easily (aside from putting each in its own page), so dual-blog approach might be cleaner.
Use the Lock Page code injection to style the password prompt. We’ll include a friendly message and maybe a link like “Not a member? [Join here]” on that lock screen, which we can do via simple HTML injection (Squarespace’s lock page can be styled with custom code as noted)
.
The membership page will explain the tiers and have a Join CTA that likely leads to a payment. If we are not using Squarespace’s Member Areas purchase flow, we might direct “Join Membership” to the Shopify site (Lillier) to handle the checkout for membership purchase. Or possibly to a simple checkout (Squarespace Commerce does allow selling a subscription product – we could utilize that just to take payment and then email the person the password). The exact method is outside this site’s scope but should be clarified. Regardless, for our site implementation, the join button can link to whatever sign-up method is decided (could be an external form or a Shopify product page).
We will clarify these assumptions with the client, but ensure our code can accommodate changes. If later they switch to a true Member Area, our structure (sections and content) remains the same; only the gating method changes.
Note: Because this gating is “light,” we must set expectations that it’s not foolproof security – determined individuals might guess the password or share it. Given the “no dashboard” requirement, this trade-off is likely acceptable initially. The focus is on giving genuine members a reasonably easy way to access content while keeping casual visitors out, without deploying a full software solution. We’ll document in the handoff notes how to change the password or move to a more robust solution in the future if membership grows (e.g., enabling Member Areas or integrating a third-party service).
7. Handoff for Content Editing
To ensure long-term maintainability and easy handoff to a non-technical client, we will prepare documentation and configure the site such that the client can perform common updates without breaking the code:
Editable Content Guide: Provide a brief guide (could be part of the README or a separate doc) listing which content can be edited through Squarespace and how. For example: “Homepage hero text – edit via Squarespace page editor: navigate to Home page, first section, edit the Text Block text. Do not remove the text block or section.” And “Homepage hero background – replace the image by editing the section’s background image or the Image Block in that section.” By mapping content in this way, the client knows what’s safe to change. This ties back to our minimal section approach, which ensures that most text and images are indeed Squarespace-editable.
Reusable Sections & New Pages: Explain that if the client wants to add a new page or section later, they should duplicate existing sections to maintain design consistency. Squarespace 7.1 allows saving sections or duplicating them on pages. For instance, if they need another page similar to About, they can duplicate the About page as a starting point. Our code is mostly global, so it will style new pages/sections as long as the structure (classes or section types) is recognized. If they create something brand new, it might not automatically be styled – hence duplicating is safer. We can even save a couple of blank “template sections” in the site (not visible on any page) that contain the basic structure and classes for, say, a two-column text/image section, which they can copy when needed.
Training: During handoff, schedule a walkthrough with the client (or provide a video) to show how to perform simple edits: editing text in place, swapping an image (Squarespace makes that as simple as clicking the image block and uploading a new image), and adding a new story to the blog. Emphasize that they should avoid deleting certain blocks that our CSS expects (for example, if a section is designed assuming one heading and one paragraph block, deleting one might affect styling).
Safe Mode & Recovery: Inform the client about Squarespace’s Safe Mode for custom code. If a future code change causes issues, Squarespace can disable code injection via safe mode to let an admin fix it
. While we as developers will handle code updates via GitHub, it’s useful for the client to know in case they see something broken – they can alert a developer rather than trying to fix code themselves. Also, because code is in GitHub, we have an audit trail of changes and can roll back if needed.
By clearly delineating what the client can do without touching code, we fulfill the goal of owner editing and extension. The client can evolve content and even add pages within the boundaries of the styles we’ve set, and call a developer only when they need new functionality or major design changes.
8. Squarespace 7.1 Constraints and Workarounds
It’s important to acknowledge the limitations of Squarespace 7.1 so we design our implementation plan within those constraints and avoid pitfalls:
No Full Template Access: As noted, Squarespace 7.1 doesn’t allow editing the raw HTML templates or uploading our own theme. We cannot fundamentally change the markup structure of pages – only inject CSS/JS to alter appearance and behavior
. Our plan uses code injection and minimal sections as a workaround to achieve a custom feel without template access. We must live with certain Squarespace DOM structures and class names, tailoring our CSS/JS around them.
Loading Order and Performance: Injected code (especially JavaScript) loads after Squarespace’s own content, which can cause slight delays or visual pops if our code rearranges things post-load
. To mitigate this:
We kept most layout styling in CSS (which applies as soon as the CSS file loads, hopefully in the <head> to reduce flicker). Critical CSS for initial layout can even be inlined in the <head> if necessary to avoid waiting for a file.
We use defer for JS so it doesn’t block the page, and design interactions (like the modal) that don’t affect initial paint. A user likely won’t click “Ask a question” the millisecond the page loads, so it’s fine if our modal script initializes a moment later.
We avoid heavy DOM manipulations where possible. For example, instead of using JS to move elements around on load (which would definitely cause a flash), we try to structure HTML in the editor close to what we need and use CSS positioning. If we do need to insert an element (like the AI modal container), we do it quickly at the end of body.
Squarespace Classes and IDs: Squarespace might change some auto-generated IDs or class names if content is edited. We have to be cautious not to overfit our selectors. For example, rather than targeting a very specific ID that could change if the section is recreated, consider adding a known HTML element we control (like wrapping a text in a span with class hero-headline) so we can target .hero-headline in CSS. We balanced this against keeping the editor clean for the client. In critical places, we might inject a <span class="cnb-hook"> via the HTML editor around certain text – small enough that the client likely won’t disturb it – to have stable hooks.
Third-Party Scripts: If any are needed (say, an analytics snippet or a chat widget beyond the AI concierge), they should be added carefully. Code injection can handle them, but too many scripts can slow down the site. We’ll assume for now only basic analytics (Google Analytics or similar) which Squarespace can handle through its settings or we add via header injection.
Testing Forms or Commerce: If the site has any forms (perhaps a “Work with Amanda – Contact Form” or a newsletter signup), we should use Squarespace’s native form block for reliability. Style it with CSS to match our theme. Avoid custom form code if possible (Squarespace forms integrate with their backend nicely). For membership sign-up, as discussed, we likely direct to Shopify or another method, so we won’t implement a custom form in Squarespace aside from maybe a simple “Contact us to request an invite” for Blind Dinners.
Known Bugs: Keep an eye on any known 7.1 quirks. For example, some Squarespace templates have issues where code injection CSS might not apply due to Ajax page transitions. If the site uses Ajax loading between pages (some templates do), CSS added via code injection might not reapply on navigation. A workaround is to disable Ajax loading (we can turn off the “Enable Ajax Loading” setting in site settings if it’s on) so that each page load freshly includes our CSS/JS. Alternatively, ensure our JS re-attaches styles on SPA navigation events. But simplest: turn off Ajax if present, to be safe, so each page behaves independently.
SEO & Performance: Using custom code means we take on some responsibility for SEO (Squarespace SEO settings will still work for basic things like meta tags, but if we hide content behind scripts, ensure that important text is still present in the HTML for crawlers). We didn’t plan any content to load via JS (we’re using static content in the editor), so SEO is fine. Also, optimize images and assets since we’re not fully leveraging Squarespace’s style editor optimization. For example, if we add custom background images via CSS, ensure they are properly sized/compressed. If using Squarespace’s image blocks, it will handle responsive image variants.
By understanding these limitations, our implementation avoids fighting the platform unnecessarily. We acknowledge we cannot achieve certain things on Squarespace that a fully custom site could (for instance, truly dynamic filtering of content without an API), but we’ve designed the site within these bounds so that it delivers the intended experience without hitting a wall. If a future feature request demands something Squarespace can’t do (e.g. truly interactive webapp behavior), at that point we’d consider other solutions or the planned integration with Shopify/other tools. For now, the approach is solid for the defined scope.
9. Previewing, Testing, and Launch Workflow
Finally, detail how to efficiently preview changes and deploy updates, given the code-first workflow:
Staging Environment: Because Squarespace doesn’t have a traditional staging server, we use the “safe staging/duplicate workflow” mentioned in the outline. One approach is to duplicate the site within Squarespace. Squarespace allows exporting the site or duplicating it to a new trial site. We can maintain a parallel “staging” site where we apply code updates first to test in a live environment (just not public). This staging site could be on a temporary subdomain or password-protected entirely (via site-wide password). Once we verify everything, we replicate the changes on the live site (or in some cases, swap domains). This is especially useful if the site is already live and in use – we wouldn’t want to disrupt it while overhauling the design.
Using Preview Mode: If duplicating is not feasible, an alternative is to do major changes on the live site but keep it unlaunched or behind a coming-soon page until ready. For example, Squarespace has a site-wide password option; we could lock the site while building, then remove the password on launch. We likely have an existing site URL to work with (as the outline says “built in the existing Squarespace site + URL”), so possibly the site is already in progress. We’ll coordinate a method that causes minimal downtime – perhaps create all new pages and sections alongside any old content, and only switch navigation over when ready.
GitHub Integration: While Squarespace can’t auto-deploy from Git, we can still streamline updates: Do all editing in local files or a code editor, commit to GitHub, review changes, and then copy-paste the final code into Squarespace. To make this easier, keep related code contiguous. For instance, if adding a new section style, group those CSS rules together so you can easily copy that block from the diff. Alternatively, if using external hosting for assets, simply pushing to GitHub (which triggers the CDN update) may be enough – the Squarespace site will then pull the new files on refresh. We must coordinate cache busting (maybe update the linked file URL with a version query param when we want to force update, or instruct client to hard refresh). Document this in the README: e.g., “After pushing a CSS change, update the injection link to main.css?v=2 to ensure Squarespace serves the latest version.”
Browser Testing: Before launch, test the site on multiple devices and browsers. Ensure the code injection works consistently. Pay attention to the special pages (password lock page, 404 page if styled, etc.). We should simulate a scenario: a non-logged-in user clicking a members-only story sees the lock page and it looks right; a logged-in (or password-entered) user can see content. Also test the membership signup flow: click “Join Membership” – does it go to the correct place (Shopify or Squarespace checkout)? This needs to be seamless.
Squarespace QA: Use Squarespace’s built-in checks (there’s a pre-launch checklist in their docs) for things like SEO descriptions, social share images, etc. While not code-related, ensure that our code hasn’t hidden any content that should be available for SEO (for instance, if we have text in images or in JS only – which we avoided). Fill in page descriptions and titles via Squarespace settings as usual.
Launch: If we used a staging site or password, coordinate removing that. If we had a duplicate site approach, we might need to swap the domain mapping from an old site to the new one (Squarespace support can assist or has guidelines for that). Make sure the live domain uses the new site and everything still works on the custom code after domain change (hard-coded URLs in code should be minimal; use relative URLs or robust selectors so domain change doesn’t break anything).
Post-Launch Monitoring: After launch, monitor site for any issues (broken scripts, layout issues, any Squarespace updates that might affect us). Because custom code is present, if Squarespace changes something in their platform, we should verify nothing is impacted. For example, if Squarespace updates their base template CSS classes in an update, our CSS might need adjustments (unlikely for core elements, but possible). Keeping the code in GitHub will allow tracking any fixes.
By following this testing and launch plan, we ensure a smooth deployment with minimal surprises. It also gives the client confidence – we’re not just designing in the blind; we are testing in a live environment to ensure the approach is solid.
References: The above plan incorporates the project’s content structure and goals as outlined in prior documents. We prioritized a code-driven implementation to meet the goal of easy owner editing with a clear structure. We referenced the navigation and copy documents to ensure the site’s pages (Home, About, Work With Amanda, Learn, Stories, Blind Dinners, Membership, Login) and their content blocks are accounted for. The need for lightweight gating was confirmed by notes that some stories/resources are for members only, leading us to suggest password-protected content as a Phase 1 solution. We also heeded known Squarespace 7.1 limitations, such as no template code access and injected code performance considerations
, to ensure our approach remains maintainable. By following this guide, a developer can implement the Cupcakes + Broccoli site in Squarespace 7.1 effectively, creating a flexible yet easy-to-update platform for the client.

https://github.com/scampbe3/CNB.git is the source of our repo. Image attached is our local repo directory. All files shown blank inside for now. Let's focus specifically on the Home Page for CnB now. Using our pinpointed methodology, and using the client's docs as guidance, guide me through the specific creation process for this page. Thanks.

Thought for 9m 9s
Got it. Here’s a Home Page build plan for C+B (Squarespace 7.1) that matches your “code-first / minimal Squarespace UI work / client can still edit text + images” methodology.

1) Lock the Home page structure (from the client docs)
These are the Home sections we’re building (in this order), pulled straight from the doc language:

Hero: headline + subhead/body + 2 CTAs (Join Membership / Learn More) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


What This Is: “Built Around Experience” + body + inline link to About 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


AI Concierge preview: headline + body + example prompts + CTA “Ask a question”, and it should open as an overlay/modal (no navigation away) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Learn: headline + body + CTA Explore Resources 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Work With Amanda: headline + body + CTA 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Blind Dinners: headline + body + CTA 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Membership: headline + body + 2 CTAs (Join / Compare) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Closing: headline + body + final CTA Explore Membership 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


(Separately, the “Website Copy WIP” PDF has a slightly different Home framing/CTA set, but the headline + “Explore Resources / Join the Community” CTAs match, so we can keep the structure above and just swap copy if needed.)

2) Your “Squarespace UI minimum” rule: how we’ll do it
Because you only have header/footer code injection (and no code blocks), the winning pattern is:

In Squarespace: use only basic native blocks (Heading, Text, Button, Form) so the client can edit later.

In code: style everything (typography, spacing, buttons, layout, sections) using your repo-hosted CSS + JS.

For reliable targeting: assign an Anchor ID to each section, then your JS adds stable classes to the correct <section> so your CSS stays clean.

This keeps you out of “dragging boxes around” while still leaving the client with simple edits (text/images/button links).

3) Repo: paste these files in (your screenshot paths)
Your repo shows:

assets/css/main.css

js/main.js

js/ai-concierge.js

Since they’re blank now, overwrite each file fully with the following.

A) assets/css/main.css (overwrite entire file)

4) Host these files from GitHub (fastest: jsDelivr)
Once you commit/push, you can load them in Squarespace via jsDelivr:

CSS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/assets/css/main.css

JS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/js/ai-concierge.js

JS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/js/main.js

When you edit code and Squarespace doesn’t update immediately, append a cache buster:

...main.css?v=home1

...main.js?v=home1

5) Squarespace: paste your injections (exactly where)
Go to Settings → Advanced → Code Injection.

Header Injection
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/assets/css/main.css?v=home1">
Footer Injection
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/js/ai-concierge.js?v=home1"></script>
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/js/main.js?v=home1"></script>
6) Squarespace: build the Home page with minimal blocks + anchors
Create/open the Home page → Edit.

For each section below:

Add a Blank Section

Open that section’s settings and set Anchor Link to the ID I give you (this is critical)

Section 1: Hero
Anchor Link: cnb-home-hero

Add blocks in this order:

Heading (H1): “Black ownership is Black survival, freedom and wealth.” 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Text (1 block): subhead + body + “This work is led by Amanda Johnson.” 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Button: “Join Membership” → link to Membership page 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Button: “Learn More About Cupcakes + Broccoli” → link to About page 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 2: What This Is
Anchor Link: cnb-home-what

Blocks:

Heading (H2): “Built Around Experience” 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Text: body copy 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Button (or link inside text): “Learn how Cupcakes + Broccoli works” → About page 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 3: AI Concierge Preview (Phase 1 placeholder)
Anchor Link: cnb-home-ai

Blocks:

Heading (H2): “Ask What You Are Actually Stuck On” 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Text: body copy + premium note 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Text: “Example Prompts:” + the 4 prompts 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Form block (recommended): single field + button text “Ask a question” 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Our JS intercepts submit and opens the placeholder modal (meets the overlay requirement) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 4: Learn
Anchor Link: cnb-home-learn

Blocks:

Heading: “Practical Learning You Can Use” 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Text: body copy 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Button: “Explore Resources” → Learn page 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 5: Work With Amanda
Anchor Link: cnb-home-work

Blocks:

Heading + Text + Button per doc 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 6: Blind Dinners
Anchor Link: cnb-home-dinners

Blocks:

Heading + Text + Button per doc 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 7: Membership
Anchor Link: cnb-home-membership

Blocks:

Heading + Text + 2 Buttons (Join / Compare) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


Section 8: Closing
Anchor Link: cnb-home-closing

Blocks:

Heading + Text + Button (Explore Membership) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


7) Quick “does our methodology work?” checklist
Can the client change hero text and buttons without touching code? (Yes: all blocks are native)

Are we avoiding Squarespace visual styling? (Yes: we’re relying on injected CSS)

Are we anchored to stable selectors? (Yes: section anchor IDs → JS adds classes)

AI “Ask a question” opens overlay and closes back to same scroll? (Yes: placeholder modal + scroll lock)

If you tell me what Squarespace calls the section setting in your UI (it’s usually “Anchor Link” under section settings), I can adjust the selectors to match exactly how your template renders the IDs (on the <section> vs an inner anchor element).

So a couple things. We have no visible changes when we test our squarespace home page - as in, we have no effects from our custom code. There are some console errors, and I am unsure if these are related, because we have legacy custom code on this site injected into the footer, which has no relation to the new site we are building at this same squarespace domain. So I removed the legacy custom injected code, and then I returned it to the custom footer injection, and in either case we have no visible custom code from our new code affecting our new home page test run. Anyway, what's the best way to make headway in this scenario? We have the console errors here:

And the legacy code is attached as a txt doc.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4m 31s
You’ve got a lot of noise in that console log, but there’s one item that can absolutely block your progress:

The one error that matters
This is coming from your legacy injected script:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')

In the legacy code, you attach an event listener like this (unconditionally):

document.getElementById("category-select").addEventListener(...) 
custom_footer_code_injected_leg…


If #category-select doesn’t exist on the page you’re testing (your new homepage/test page), that line throws and halts the rest of that script execution. If your new “load my GitHub JS/CSS” code lives after this inside the same injected block, it will never run.

Also, the legacy code assumes #category-select exists in multiple places (e.g., populateCategories) and will throw there too. 
custom_footer_code_injected_leg…


The Facebook/Statsig/YUI stuff is mostly Squarespace + adblocker noise and can be ignored for now.

Best way to make headway (fastest path)
Step 1 — Prove your new code injection is executing
In Settings → Advanced → Code Injection → Header, temporarily paste:

<style>
  body::before{
    content:"CNB HEADER INJECTION LOADED";
    position:fixed; z-index:999999;
    top:10px; left:10px;
    padding:8px 10px;
    background:#000; color:#0f0;
    font:12px/1.2 monospace;
  }
</style>
In Footer, temporarily paste:

<script>console.log("CNB FOOTER INJECTION LOADED", location.pathname);</script>
Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R).
If you don’t see the green label + console log, stop and fix that first (wrong place, caching, editing a different site, etc.).

Step 2 — Defuse the legacy script so it can’t break new pages
If you still need that legacy code kept around, wrap it so it only runs when its DOM exists.

Where to change: inside the legacy injected footer code.

Replace the line that currently does this:

document.getElementById("category-select").addEventListener("change", event => {
  renderCatalog(event.target.value);
});
With this safe version:

const categorySelectEl = document.getElementById("category-select");
if (categorySelectEl) {
  categorySelectEl.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
    renderCatalog(event.target.value);
  });
} else {
  // Not the catalog page—do nothing.
  return;
}
That directly addresses the crash point in your legacy code. 
custom_footer_code_injected_leg…


Even better: move the entire legacy script off global injection and into the specific page that needs it:

Pages → (the old page) → ⚙️ → Advanced → Page Footer Code Injection
So it never touches your new CNB pages.

Step 3 — Load your GitHub-hosted CSS/JS the “Squarespace way”
Squarespace code injection can style/behavior your site, but it cannot “render” your repo’s HTML into the page. So the pattern is:

Build page structure in Squarespace sections (minimal)

Control look/feel in your own CSS

Add behaviors with your JS

To host assets on GitHub cleanly, use GitHub Pages (recommended) or jsDelivr.

Option A: GitHub Pages (recommended)

Repo → Settings → Pages

Source: main branch, /root (or /docs if you prefer)

Your files will be served at something like:
https://scampbe3.github.io/CNB/...

Then inject:

Header injection

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://scampbe3.github.io/CNB/assets/css/main.css?v=1">
Footer injection

<script defer src="https://scampbe3.github.io/CNB/assets/js/ai-concierge.js?v=1"></script>
<script defer src="https://scampbe3.github.io/CNB/assets/js/main.js?v=1"></script>
(That ?v=1 is just cache-busting while you iterate.)

Now: build the CNB Home Page with your “minimal Squarespace UI, maximum code control” method
A) Create the minimum Squarespace structure (you do this once)
On the CNB Home page, add only these sections, and give each a Section ID (Edit Section → Advanced → Section ID):

cnb-hero

cnb-what-we-do

cnb-ai-concierge

cnb-learn

cnb-work-with-amanda

cnb-blind-dinners

cnb-membership

cnb-closing

Inside each section, use only basic Squarespace blocks:

Text blocks (Headings + paragraph)

Button blocks

One image block if you want a placeholder image

That’s it. No “designing” beyond placing the blocks in the section.

Use the client’s actual Home copy for the first two sections
From the Website Copy WIP, the CNB homepage Hero Block copy is: headline, subhead, body, CTAs 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


And “What We Do” is “Built for Ownership” + body copy 
Website Copy_WIP_CnB and Lillie…


Also, the navigation doc tells you exactly what the homepage CTAs should point to (Join Membership → Membership page, Learn More → About, etc.) 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


For the AI Concierge section, the doc specifies it opens as a modal/overlay and keeps user on the Home page context. 
WIP CnB Navigation & Website La…


So: your Squarespace job is just entering the copy and adding the buttons with those links.

B) Put your styling system in code (your repo files)
You said these repo files are currently blank. So treat this as “replace empty with this”.

C) One tiny Squarespace UI trick to make JS wiring painless
In your AI Concierge section, set the button’s link to:

#cnb-ai-concierge

That makes it super easy for your JS to find the correct button without needing custom block IDs (and it matches the “opens as modal overlay” requirement).

Why you weren’t seeing changes
Most likely one (or more) of these:

Your legacy script is throwing and preventing later injected code in the same block from running (your error matches this exactly). 
custom_footer_code_injected_leg…


Your GitHub CSS/JS aren’t actually being loaded (wrong URL / not using Pages / cached).

Your repo files are blank, so even if they load, nothing changes.

If you do Steps 1–3 above, you’ll get visible proof immediately, then you can iterate cleanly on the homepage.

If you paste the exact current Header + Footer injection snippets you’re using (just those snippets), I can tell you instantly whether the URLs/scoping/order will work.


Sources
You said:
Ok I simply removed the legacy injected custom code in the footer. We still get the below console errors. I did as you said in all other areas. I simply changed the git urls to reflect their reality, which is that js and css dirs are NOT in assets dir. as well, I removed the v=1 appended to the urls. But otherwise, the test page anchor ids, sections, and the code in the three files is all exactly as you said to make it. So what is going wrong here? No visible effects when we test our home squarespace page. it is NOT being affected by our files uploaded to github at all.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 32s
Those console lines you pasted are all Squarespace/editor + adblock noise. None of them explain “my GitHub CSS/JS isn’t affecting the page.” The thing that does explain it is almost always one of these:

your <link>/<script> tags are not actually present on the page you’re testing

the URLs you’re using are wrong / returning 404 / not serving as executable JS/CSS

the browser cached the “blank” versions (you removed the ?v= cache-buster right after the files started as blank)

your CSS selectors don’t match Squarespace’s DOM, so the CSS loads but does nothing

Here’s the fastest way to isolate which one it is.

1) First: confirm you’re testing the live page, not the Squarespace editor
Your log includes config/… messages, which usually means you’re inside the editor shell.

Do this:

Open the page in a totally separate tab (not the editor), ideally an incognito window.

Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R).

If you only test inside /config, you can chase ghosts all day.

2) “View Source” check (takes 10 seconds)
On the live page:

Right click → View Page Source

Search for main.css or main.js

If you do not see your <link rel="stylesheet" …> and <script …> tags in the page source, then your Code Injection isn’t actually being applied to that page (wrong site, wrong injection location, not saved, etc.).
If you do see them, move on.

3) Network tab check (this tells the truth instantly)
On the live page:

DevTools → Network

Filter by main.css then main.js

Reload the page

You want to see:

Status 200

And the response body contains your CSS/JS

If you see 404, it’s the URL.
If you see 200 but the response is empty/old, it’s caching.
If you see (blocked), it’s content-type / CSP / mixed-content.

4) Put the cache-buster back (this is very likely your issue)
You said all repo files were blank at first, then you filled them in, and you removed ?v=1.

That’s a perfect recipe for: “browser cached the blank file → no changes forever.”

Put it back and increment it every time you change code:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="YOUR_URL/main.css?v=2">
<script defer src="YOUR_URL/ai-concierge.js?v=2"></script>
<script defer src="YOUR_URL/main.js?v=2"></script>
Do v=3, v=4, etc. while iterating.

5) Use a “known-good” GitHub CDN URL (recommended)
If you’re using a normal GitHub “blob” URL, it will not load as a real asset.

The easiest reliable approach (if repo is public): jsDelivr
It serves correct MIME types and caches well.

Use this format:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<user>/<repo>@<branch>/<path>

Example (adjust paths to your real repo layout):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/css/main.css?v=2">
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/js/ai-concierge.js?v=2"></script>
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/scampbe3/CNB@main/js/main.js?v=2"></script>
If your folders are at root (you said they’re not under assets/), this will match that.

Important: repo must be public for jsDelivr.

Alternative: GitHub Pages
Also solid, but requires enabling Pages in repo settings. If you haven’t, the URLs will 404.

6) Canary test so we don’t depend on Squarespace DOM
Even if your CSS loads, your selectors might not match.

Temporarily add this as the first lines of main.css:

body { outline: 10px solid lime !important; }
And add this at the top of main.js:

console.log("[CNB] main.js actually executed");
Reload the live page:

If you don’t see the lime outline → CSS isn’t loading.

If you don’t see the console log → JS isn’t loading/executing.

This avoids any “maybe the selectors are wrong” ambiguity.

Most likely cause given what you described
Because your files were blank and you removed ?v=1, the most likely situation is: you’re still loading cached blank files (either in browser cache or CDN cache). Re-adding the query string usually fixes it instantly.

Second most likely: the URLs you’re using are not “raw/CDN” asset URLs (e.g., they contain /blob/).

Paste these two things and I’ll tell you exactly what’s wrong
The exact three tags currently in Squarespace injection (the <link> and two <script> lines)

The exact URL you get when you click the CSS file in the browser (what opens in a new tab)

With just those, I can tell you if it’s (a) wrong URL format, (b) 404, (c) cached blank content, or (d) injection not present on the page.
