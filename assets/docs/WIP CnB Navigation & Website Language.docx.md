**ABOUT**   
**This Is a Founder-Led Practice**  
Cupcakes \+ Broccoli is led by Amanda Johnson.  
It is not a generic platform or a faceless subscription product. It is a founder-led practice built around experience, judgment, and care. Membership, consulting, learning, and Blind Dinners all flow from that center.  
People do not come here for hype.  
They come for clarity.

**Who Amanda Is**  
Amanda Johnson has spent her career inside complex systems where decisions matter.  
She has led strategy and marketing work inside major organizations and advised senior leaders on initiatives tied to revenue, reputation, and growth. She understands how power moves and how decisions actually get made.  
She has also worked closely with Black-owned small businesses navigating limited access and unclear rules. She understands what it means to build without a safety net.  
Cupcakes \+ Broccoli lives at the intersection of those two realities.

**How Amanda Works**  
People who work with Amanda describe a consistent pattern.

She does the work.  
She stays through execution.  
She brings structure where there is chaos and momentum where things feel stuck. This approach shapes everything at Cupcakes \+ Broccoli.

**Why Cupcakes \+ Broccoli Exists**  
Cupcakes \+ Broccoli was created after a series of professional and personal inflection points.  
After years inside corporate environments, Amanda experienced workplace harm, public undermining, and termination. She challenged that experience through formal channels and lost. What followed was uncertainty and the realization that institutional stability is often fragile, especially for Black women.  
At the same time, personal loss reshaped how she thought about time, work, and ownership.  
Cupcakes \+ Broccoli exists because relying on systems that were not built for us is not a strategy.  
Ownership is.  
---

**WORK WITH AMANDA**  
**Strategic Guidance Led by Experience**  
Working with Amanda Johnson is about clear thinking, grounded strategy, and forward motion.  
This is not packaged consulting or generic advice. It is senior-level guidance shaped by years of corporate leadership and deep, hands-on work with Black-owned small businesses.  
---

**Who This Is For**  
This work is for Black founders who:

* Are making high-impact decisions without a trusted sounding board  
* Feel stuck between vision and execution  
* Need clarity, prioritization, and momentum  
* Want direct, honest guidance rooted in real experience

If you are looking for motivation or surface-level feedback, this may not be the right fit.  
If you want thoughtful partnership and direction, you are in the right place.  
---

**Amanda’s Background**  
Amanda Johnson has spent her career inside environments where the stakes are real.  
She has led strategy and marketing work inside large organizations, partnered with senior executives, and owned initiatives tied directly to revenue, reputation, and growth. She understands how decisions are made, how power operates, and how ideas move from proposal to execution.  
She has also worked closely with Black-owned small businesses navigating limited access, unclear systems, and uneven support. She understands what it means to build without a safety net.  
That dual perspective shapes every engagement.

---

**How Amanda Works**  
Amanda works as a strategic partner, not a task-taker.  
Her approach is collaborative, direct, and grounded in reality. She listens closely, asks the right questions, and helps founders make decisions they can stand behind.  
People who work with Amanda often describe her as clear, detail-oriented, calm under pressure, and deeply invested in seeing work through execution.  
She does not disappear after the idea. She stays with the work.  
---

**What Working Together Can Look Like**  
Engagements are intentionally flexible and tailored to each founder’s needs. Work may include:

* Clarifying direction and priorities  
* Pressure-testing ideas and strategies  
* Translating vision into actionable plans  
* Navigating moments of transition or uncertainty  
* Acting as a trusted thought partner during growth or change

This is consultative work shaped around context, not templates.  
---

**STORIES**  
**Stories From the Work**  
Cupcakes \+ Broccoli is shaped by real people navigating real decisions.  
The Stories section is where experience is shared honestly. Founders, collaborators, and Amanda reflect on what building actually looks like. The choices. The uncertainty. The moments that change direction.  
These stories are not performance.  
They are perspective.  
---

**What You Will Find Here**  
Stories at Cupcakes \+ Broccoli take many forms.  
You may find:

* Reflections by Amanda on ownership, work, and decision-making  
* Stories from Black founders navigating growth, transition, and uncertainty  
* Perspectives from collaborators who have worked closely with Amanda  
* Essays on building inside systems that were not designed for us

Each story exists to offer clarity, not polish.  
---

**Why Stories Matter**  
Building can be isolating, especially when decisions are carried alone.  
Stories help create context. They remind us that uncertainty is part of the work and that momentum is built over time. They create connection without performance.  
This is where shared experience lives.  
---

**How Stories Connect to the Work**  
Stories do not stand apart from the platform. They inform it.  
Many stories connect directly to learning resources, consulting insights, member conversations, or Blind Dinners. Together, they add depth and perspective.

**Blind Dinners and Shared Experience**  
Some stories grow out of real connection.  
Blind Dinners are invitation-based gatherings where Black founders come together for honest conversation. While the dinners themselves are private, the reflections they inspire often live here.

**BLIND DINNERS**  
**An Invitation to a Seat at the Table**  
Blind Dinners are intimate, invitation-only gatherings hosted by Amanda Johnson.  
They are designed for people who carry responsibility, influence, and vision, often without many places to put it down. These dinners create space for honesty, depth, and connection among people who understand what it means to build, lead, and decide.  
This is not an event.  
It is a gathering.  
---

**Who Is at the Table**  
Blind Dinners bring together a carefully curated mix of guests, including:

* Business owners and founders  
* Influencers and cultural leaders  
* Actors, directors, and creatives  
* Educators and thought leaders  
* Attorneys, real estate professionals, and operators

The table is intentionally Black, alongside other People of Color and LGBTQIA+ guests. The goal is not sameness. It is shared understanding, mutual respect, and lived experience navigating systems that were not built with us in mind.  
Guests are invited because of how they think, how they move through the world, and how they hold responsibility, not because of follower count or title alone.  
---

**What a Blind Dinner Is Like**  
Guests do not arrive to pitch, perform, or promote.  
They arrive to listen, share, and be in conversation. Phones are put away. The evening unfolds slowly, with room for laughter, vulnerability, and reflection. Conversation moves where it needs to go.  
Everyone comes in as themselves.  
Everyone leaves having been seen.  
---

**About the Food**  
The food served at Blind Dinners is home cooked by Amanda.  
Amanda is not a chef. She cooks because cooking is how she creates care and belonging. Meals are prepared thoughtfully and served family-style.  
The food is not about spectacle. It is about warmth, generosity, and the feeling of being welcomed into someone’s home.  
---

**Why Blind Dinners Exist**  
Leadership can be isolating.  
Blind Dinners exist because there are few spaces where people with influence can be human without explanation. These gatherings offer relief from performance and space for truth.  
They are intentionally small so that trust can form and conversation can deepen.  
---

**How Blind Dinners Are Hosted**  
Blind Dinners are hosted personally by Amanda Johnson.  
Each guest list is curated with care. The balance of voices at the table matters. Dinners are hosted in private settings and are limited by design.  
Because of this, Blind Dinners are not open to the public and cannot be requested directly.  
---

**Relationship to Membership**  
Blind Dinners are part of the broader Cupcakes \+ Broccoli ecosystem.  
Eligibility is reserved for select members, typically within the Premium tier. Membership creates shared context, continuity, and alignment beyond a single evening.  
**Primary CTA:**

**Privacy and Trust**  
What happens at a Blind Dinner stays at the table.  
Stories may inspire reflection or future writing, but individual conversations are held with care and discretion. Privacy is foundational to the experience.  
---

**An Invitation**

Cupcakes \+ Broccoli exists to meet that reality directly.

**INTERNAL LOGIN IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF FOR STEPHEN**  
*(Not for the website)*  
**Login Scope and Intent**  
Login in Phase 1 is designed to provide access control and continuity, not a full member dashboard.  
The goal is a calm, reliable experience that supports membership access without unnecessary complexity.  
---

**Authentication Method**

* Login via **email and password only**  
* No social login in Phase 1  
* Password reset handled through standard Squarespace flow

---

**What Is Stored in Member Profiles**

* Name  
* Email address  
* Membership tier (Core or Premium)  
* Subscription and billing status  
* Access permissions to gated content

No additional profile customization in Phase 1\.  
---

**What Is Not Stored in Phase 1**

* AI conversation history  
* Resource download history  
* Saved templates or files  
* Personalized dashboards or analytics

AI conversations are session-based and not persisted.  
Templates are downloadable files and live with the user after download.  
---

**Post-Login Behavior**

* If a user attempts to access gated content, logging in should return them to that page  
* If a user logs in directly, route them to the Home page  
* Do not force users into a dashboard or account hub

---

**Login Page Design Guidance**

* Minimal layout  
* No marketing or upsell language  
* Clear form fields and utility links only  
* Calm tone consistent with the rest of the site

---

**Phase 2 Considerations (Not for Phase 1 Build)**

* Saved AI conversation history  
* Download tracking  
* Member dashboards  
* Deeper personalization

Phase 1 should not include placeholders or UI elements referencing these features.  
---

**Summary Directive**  
Phase 1 login supports access, not identity. The value of Cupcakes \+ Broccoli lives in the work, not the interface.
