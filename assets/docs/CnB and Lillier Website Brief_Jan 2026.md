BRIEF January 2026
Amanda  Johnson
OVERVIEW

We are launching two distinct digital products under one parent vision.

Cupcakes \+ Broccoli (C+B) is an education, tool, and convening  platform for Black, Brown, and queer entrepreneurs or people  seriously considering starting a business.

Lillier is a daily, one-stop-shop marketplace for Black consumers and  Black-owned products, with secondary focus on Latino, queer, and  young mainstream audiences.
CORE OBJECTIVES

Design and build two standalone websites that:
• Share a unified design system and sensibility
• Serve very different user intents and frequencies
• Feel editorial, edgy, and chic
• Are exceptionally clean and usable on mobile
first
BRAND RELATIONSHIP

The connection between Cupcakes \+ Broccoli and Lillier should mirror  Dior fashion vs Dior beauty: different purposes and usage patterns,  shared visual DNA. The connection should be subtle and embedded,  not overt.
IMPORTANT:
THE LOGOS ARE  LOCKED.

We will not be changing

the logos. The focus of this

exercise is to design and

build the websites.
THIS IS NOT:

This project is not a brand identity exercise, logo redesign, or re naming effort.
THIS IS:

We’re most excited to see how partners interpret these principles into  thoughtful, scalable systems rather than surface-level styling.
PLATFORMS

REVENUE MODEL

Cupcakes \+ Broccoli
● Subscription-based revenue
● Subscriptions should feel like access and belonging, not
commerce
● Clean, calm checkout and member experience
● Editorial pacing preserved after login

Lillier
● Transactional e-commerce
● Designed for scale, repeat purchase, and operational
growth
VISUAL PRINCIPLES  (SHARED)

• Editorial, edgy, and chic
• High-contrast, confident, intentional
• Minimal, but never generic
• Fashion and culture-informed, not startup-branded
• Strong typography, whitespace, and visual rhythm
• Premium without ornamentation
• Calm, not cluttered
• Built for impact on mobile

The sites should feel closer to a fashion or culture publication than a tech  platform.

C+B

PHILOSOPHY

What Peloton is for someone focused on physical health, Cupcakes \+ Broccoli  should be for someone building or running a business.

• Designed to support consistency, discipline, and momentum • Tools, classes, and AI guidance feel guided and motivating • No dashboards, charts, or enterprise software aesthetics • Structure without visual heaviness
• Habit-forming without feeling mechanical
LILLIER

PHILOSOPHY

What Amazon is for convenience, Lillier should be for trust, taste, and  everyday living.

Lillier should feel like Amazon built by someone with taste.

• Designed to be a default destination, not a special occasion • Built for frequent use without visual fatigue
• Curation replaces endless choice
• Familiar categories, elevated presentation
• Discovery without overwhelm
VIBE

The brand is Black, chic, aspirational and  forward-looking, grounded in Black  American history and Africana without  nostalgia.

The tone is young, confident, and  editorial. Imagery should feel authored  and bold, pulling from fashion, culture,  and art references that span heritage and  futurism.

The design should anticipate and elevate  high-caliber photography, with the  understanding that the visual impact of  the site will be driven by the strength of  the imagery we are able to secure.

U/X DIRECTION – CRITICAL

Mobile is the primary design lens.

Desktop should feel like an expansion of mobile, not the reverse.

• Editorial plus tool-driven experience • Clear navigation for classes, AI tools, and  resources
• Minimal CTAs, high signal
• Authored, intentional flows
• Photography treated as cultural  documentation, not event marketing
• Fast, frictionless, habit-forming • Strong navigation, search, and taxonomy  on mobile
• Designed for thumb-first browsing • Everyday utility, not precious or niche

SCOPE

• Brand architecture and shared design system
• Two responsive, mobile-first websites
• CMS-driven builds
• Subscription functionality for C+B
• Full e-commerce for Lillier
• SEO and analytics baked in

Platform recommendations welcome within these constraints.

Deliverables are expected to include core page templates, navigation  systems, and responsive layouts for both brands, with development through  launch on Squarespace (C+B) and Shopify (Lillier). Content structure and  visual systems should be fully defined, with flexibility for future expansion.
PROCESS

Amanda Johnson will serve as the primary decision-maker and creative lead  for this project. Feedback will be centralized, with an emphasis on clarity,  momentum and thoughtful iteration rather than committee-based revision.
SUCCESS

CRITERIA

Success is defined by a site experience that feels editorial, confident, and  culturally fluent on first impression, while supporting frequent return, ease of  use, and long-term scalability. The sites should feel considered rather than  trendy, and immediately signal taste, trust, and intention to the right audience.
WHAT MATTERS MOST

MOBILE FIRST

ENDURING U/X

Strong UX for first-time and  repeat users

02\. 04\.

DESIGN

REFERENCE

CAMO by Thandiwe Muriu

CAMO demonstrates how cultural reference can function as visual structure  rather than decoration. Pattern is treated as architecture. Color is intentional,  not expressive. The subject is centered, calm, and authoritative. Heritage is  embedded, not explained. The work feels editorial, modern, and luxurious,  balancing Africana with futurism through restraint and precision.

• Pattern used with discipline, not excess
• Texture as a design system, not an accent
• Boldness through confidence and stillness
• Culture embedded into form, not layered on top
DESIGN

REFERENCE (cont.)

This reference informs how photography, texture, and layout should work  together to create a visual language that is unapologetically Black, chic, and  contemporary.

• Pattern used with discipline, not excess
• Texture as a design system, not an accent
• Boldness through confidence and stillness
• Culture embedded into form, not layered on top

DESIGN

PRECEDENTS

These case studies serve as design

precedents that inform structure,

pacing, and experience. They are

referenced for architectural and

behavioral principles rather than

visual imitation.
DIOR

Editorial restraint, shared DNA,  visual hierarchy

• Strong hierarchy driven by  typography and spacing • Luxury signaled through  restraint, not decoration
• Visual calm even within  complex offerings
• Mobile experience feels  intentional, not compressed

Why it matters for C+B and  Lillier:

Peloton is a reference for  behavior, not aesthetics. It  demonstrates how to create  consistency, discipline, and  motivation without clutter or  enterprise software patterns.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRANDS EXAMPLE: DIOR

WHAT I

LIKE:

Two lines, Fashion/Accessories and
Fragrance/Beauty, same aesthetic

WHAT I

LIKE:

A landing page, e.g.
www.cupcakesandbroccoli.com\\corp
orate, that points to both companies:
C+B on the left and Lillier on the
right. The idea is that we can present
both brands side by side and it has
similar clean aesthetic.
PELOTON

Habit, cadence, behavioral  design

• Designed for daily or near daily return
• Guidance feels personal and  encouraging
• Tools support momentum  without dominating the

experience
• Structure is felt through flow  and tone, not dashboards

Why it matters for C+B:

Peloton is a reference for  behavior, not aesthetics. It  demonstrates how to create  consistency, discipline, and  motivation without clutter or  enterprise software patterns.
MASTERCLASS

Aspirational learning, cinematic  authority

• Video-first learning presented  with restraint and confidence • Classes feel cinematic,  intentional, and premium
• Structure without pressure or  hustle language
• Encourages return through  rhythm, not reminders

Why it matters for C+B:

MasterClass shows how

education can feel aspirational  and authored. It is a strong  reference for presenting classes  and expert guidance without  visual noise or SaaS-style UI.
AESOP

Everyday commerce with taste  and trust

• Utilitarian products presented  editorially
• Calm, confident mobile  shopping experience
• Minimal promotion, maximum  trust
• Designed for replenishment  without visual fatigue

Why it matters for Lillier:

Aesop shows how everyday  purchasing can feel intentional  and elevated. It is a strong  reference for building a high frequency commerce experience  without chaos or noise.
