ABOUT PAGE 

Hero Headline: 

Own Your Joy 

Subhead: 

Making it easy to support Black-owned businesses every day. 

Our Story: 

Lillier was created to solve a simple problem. People want to support Black-owned businesses, but it is often hard to do consistently. 

Shopping usually means visiting multiple websites, placing separate orders and paying multiple shipping fees. Over time, convenience wins and intention gets lost. 

Lillier brings everything together in one place. One cart. One checkout. Thousands of Black-owned businesses offering the products people actually use every day. 

Buying Black should not require extra effort. It should feel natural, accessible and rewarding.  
Why Lillier Exists: 

Black-owned businesses face real barriers to distribution, visibility and growth. Even brands with exceptional products struggle to reach customers at scale. 

Lillier exists to change that. 

We are building a retail platform that prioritizes ownership, quality and sustainability. By bringing Black-owned brands together under one roof, we make it easier for customers to shop with intention and for businesses to grow with consistency. 

Every purchase is a vote for ownership. Every cart supports real people and real livelihoods. 

Our Name: 

Lillier is named after the founder’s grandmother, Lillier Madison. 

She believed that joy was not something handed to you. It was something you had to make for yourself. 

You got to make your own self happy. 

That belief lives at the center of Lillier. Ownership is joy. Independence is joy. Building something of your own is joy.
